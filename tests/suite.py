"""The test registry - what runs, in which tier, and why.

`tools/os88test.py` reads this and nothing else.  Adding a test is adding a
row here; a test that is not in this file does not run in any tier, which is
the state all ninety of them were in before it existed.

**BEFORE ADDING ONE: docs/WRITING-TESTS.md.**  This file is the registry's
own contract - the tiers, and what earns a `full` row - and that one is how to
write the test the row points at.  The four things it exists to stop are all
visible in this file's own history: a `secs` nobody measured (the compression
family declared 2,721 seconds for rows that take 701), a `builds=True` where a
`wants=` or a private tree was the answer, a hand-rolled click at a remembered
coordinate, and a `time.sleep` that hands the guest a third less work under
load.  Its checklist is thirteen lines and takes a minute.

THE THREE TIERS.

  fast   Budget 30s. Host-side only - it reads what `make` just built and
         checks the invariants that break SILENTLY. Hangs off the default
         build, so it cannot be skipped.

  full   Budget 3 minutes. THE PRE-MERGE GATE, and it asks ONE question:
         DID YOU OBVIOUSLY BREAK THE OS?  Does it compile, does it boot,
         does it do the basic things, is anything critical gone.

  soak   No budget. Everything else - the rest of `tests/`, which is a great
         deal and is where the deep single-subject gates live.

WHY `full` IS CURATED AND NOT "ALL OF THEM", which is the thing to understand
before adding a row to it.  Measured on a cycle-accurate 5150 in a container:
a MartyPC boot to a settled desktop is **7.8 seconds**, and the emulator tests
in `tests/` run **40-75 seconds each** because each one boots its own machine
and then drives a session through it.  Instances are isolated now, so
`--marty-jobs` runs emulator rows side by side - but the lane is CORES-1 wide
and the box is four cores, so the arithmetic barely moves.

So THREE minutes is about four such rows, not fifty.  That is not a limitation
to be engineered away - it is what the machine costs - and the honest response
is to say which four and put the rest in `soak` where they are still one
command away (`os88test.py soak -k disp*`).  The runner FAILS the tier when it
overruns, so this stays true as rows are added rather than drifting until the
suite is too slow to run.  The 180s is a target for FOUR LANES on an ordinary
box; a slower one is expected to take longer, and today's tier leaves room for
that (60.3s in the runner and 75.3s of wall on a cold four-core container,
37.8s / 51.1s warm).

WHAT EARNS A `full` ROW.  ONE QUESTION: DID YOU OBVIOUSLY BREAK THE OS?  Does
it compile, does it boot, does it do the basic things, is anything critical
gone.  `bootsmoke` is the model: thirteen seconds for a boot to a desktop on
both 1bpp adapters, exercising the boot sector, FAT12, the `int 13h` splitter,
adapter detection, the heap ladder, `drv_boot` and the first paint - so it
fails for almost any serious regression, wherever it was.

Three things follow, and each one retired a row when the tier was recut:

  NOTHING APP-SPECIFIC.  A package is not the OS.  A row may DRIVE an app as
  the vehicle for a generic check - `ctoolchain` builds four C packages
  because that is what a toolchain produces - but a row whose SUBJECT is one
  program belongs in `soak`.  That is what moved `weavesmoke` (72.8s) and
  `appsmall` out.

  A KERNEL CHECK IS ALLOWED, AND SHOULD BE SHORT.  `kernresident` boots a VGA
  machine and walks `mem_tab` in 13.7s; that is the shape.  A deep sweep of
  one subsystem is not, however true it is: `smallboot` walked three adapters
  for 118s where `small128` beside it already builds that kernel and boots it.

  THE SUBJECT IS THE OS, NOT THE TREE AND NOT THE SUITE.  `buildmatrix`'s 99
  knob configurations are instruments, `bmshare` and `kernmods` are about
  build-speed variables and a size report, `martyconc` gates the emulator
  harness and `stackprose` reads prose.  Every one is worth having; none of
  them can answer this tier's question, and `buildmatrix` alone was 143s of
  a 180s budget.

A row that can only fail for one narrowly-scoped reason belongs in `soak`,
next to the change that would break it.  docs/WRITING-TESTS.md section 2.2 is
this rule written for somebody adding a row rather than moving one.

WHAT EARNS A `fast` ROW, which is the harder question and the one this list
got wrong for a long time.  `fast` is the only tier NOBODY OPTS INTO - `all`
depends on it - so every second of it is charged to the contributor who is
NOT working on its subject and has never read the code it defends.  The
question is therefore never "is this check worth having"; every row in
`tests/` is.  It is **"is it worth having to somebody who did not touch
this?"**

Two questions retire a row from `fast`, and either one on its own is enough:

  1. IS IT ABOUT ONE PACKAGE OR ONE DRIVER?  Then it is `soak`.  Whoever
     changes SKIES tests SKIES; charging every other contributor two seconds
     a build for it buys them nothing, and `soak -k 'cs*'` is one command
     run by the person it is for.

  2. CAN ONLY A KERNEL CHANGE BREAK IT?  Then it is `soak` too.  A row about
     how the kernel works INSIDE - a .bss sentinel, `.lowbss`'s order, the
     eviction ranks, `clk_mlen`'s mask - is defended by whoever edits that
     subsystem, and that is exactly the person who will run `soak -k` on it.
     `fast` is not where the kernel is proved to still work.  It is where a
     writer who has never opened that subsystem is caught breaking it by
     accident.  THE EXCEPTION IS WHAT MAKES THE RULE USEFUL: a kernel-side
     row stays if code OUTSIDE the kernel can reach it - a package, a
     driver, the SDK, or a Makefile recipe.  `api-abi` and `drvovl` are both
     kernel-side and both stay, because the other end of each is somebody
     else's file.

     AND ONE ROW STAYS FOR WHAT IT PRINTS.  `kernbudget` is kernel-internal
     by any reading, costs 28ms, and puts `KERN_BUDGET big <n>, small <n>`
     on every build - which is how kernel size drift stays visible between
     one person's commits and the next.  A row may earn `fast` by what it
     puts on the SCREEN as well as by what it catches; the bound is that it
     must be effectively free, and the number must be one the project
     actually steers by.  It is the only one, and it is the owner's call.

What survives is four families, and a new row should be able to say which
one it is joining:

  THE BOUNDARY          the kernel and the code loaded onto it, edited by
                        different people, with neither side's build saying
                        so - api-abi, stkclass, drvovl, fonts, pkgdeps
  RULES OVER EVERY LINE  what any assembly in this tree must obey, kernel
                        and package alike - asmrules, ovlchk, textrules,
                        stkbalance, stkapps, swallow
  THE SHIPPED ARTIFACTS  the floppies themselves, which anybody adding a
                        file reaches - image, pkg, diskverify, canary,
                        checkreadme
  THE TREE AND ITS SUITE duplication, generated docs, and the gates'
                        own integrity - mirror, checkdocs, docindex,
                        registry, machines, qemuown, fixtures, layout,
                        deps, stkwalker

The membership is whatever carries the tier `fast` below; the families are
how to argue about a new one.  docs/WRITING-TESTS.md section 2.1 is the same
rule written for somebody adding a row rather than moving one.
