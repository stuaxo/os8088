#   make        build build/os8088.img
#   make run    boot it in QEMU
#   make debug  boot it with QEMU waiting for gdb on :1234
#   make clean
# =============================================================================

# THE FIRST THING TO TYPE on a box you have not built on. `make deps` installs
# nasm, pkg-config + libudev-dev (which `make marty` needs and fails MINUTES IN
# without, inside cargo on the serialport crate) and qemu, by running
# tools/setup-linux.sh or tools/setup-macos.sh as the host requires. It is
# IDEMPOTENT and about a fifth of a second when everything is already there,
# so it is cheap to type when unsure - which is the point, the alternative
# being a four-minute cargo build that ends on a missing 200KB header.
#
# `make deps-check` is the same question with no install: it reports and exits
# nonzero if anything is missing.
#
# .DEFAULT_GOAL IS NOT DECORATION. `all` is 1,800 lines down, and make takes
# the FIRST TARGET IN THE FILE as the default goal - so putting these two
# rules up here, where a reader finds them, silently made `make` mean
# `make deps`: a dependency report, no floppy built, exit 0. Naming the goal
# costs one line and makes the position of every rule below it a layout
# question rather than a behavioural one. tests/unit/t_deps.py guards it.

# The `pc` machine carries a `vmport` and a `vmmouse` by default, so a guest
# that speaks SPEC.md 9.11's backdoor WINS the mouse contest here - which is
# right in v86 and on a desktop hypervisor, and wrong for automated testing,
# where tools/mouse.py drives the msserial device by relative deltas and the
# backdoor's event queue stays empty (the pointer would never move). So every
# driving recipe turns the port off; `tests/vmmouse.py` and

# flag would put the default `pc` back with $(MOUSE)'s msmouse still on the
# command line. That is both pointing devices at once, which splits absolute
# coordinates and button events across two of them and sticks [mouse_btn]
# pressed: a drag that starts and never ends. A knob whose safety depends on

# 2,568 + 1,421 = 3,993 and the override went with it. What it was really

# IT IS A MEMORY OFFSET, AND THE FILE SECTOR IS BOOT2_SECS FURTHER IN (SPEC.md

# KERNEL.SYS is KSIG_OFF/512 + BOOT2_SECS - which is why KSIGDEF2 below adds
# BOOT2_PAD to read the word out. The number was once left at the one that used
# to put it on file sector 36, and that moved the probe to file sector 49: a
# run's FIRST HALF on 360KB and on 1.44MB, the half that loads correctly on
# exactly the machine the canary exists to catch.
#
# **THIS CONSTANT IS TIED TO BOOT2_SECS AND HAS TO MOVE WITH IT.** SPEC.md
# 2.9.12 took the blob from 13 sectors to 19, which slid the same memory offset
# six sectors further into the file and straight out of the band - 11776 landed
# on file sector 42, a first half on all three geometries. tests/unit/t_canary.py
# re-derives the band from every shipped image's own BPB and is what caught
# this - it is in the FAST tier, so a blob resize that forgets this line stops
# the build rather than shipping a canary that cannot fire.
#
# **AND IT IS TIED TO THE SET OF SHIPPED GEOMETRIES, which is what moved it
# last.** The common band is the INTERSECTION over every shipped disk, and the
# 1.2MB 5.25" geometry (SPEC.md 19) does not overlap the old one anywhere: its
# data area starts at LBA 29 and its run is 30 sectors, so file sector 36 - the
# middle of 33..38, which served the other three for two years - sits 5 sectors
# into a run's FIRST half there. The canary would have been loaded correctly on
# precisely the machine it exists to catch, on one disk of the four, silently.
# That is the same defect the paragraph above is about, and the fourth geometry
# re-introduced it rather than the constant drifting.
#
# **AND IT IS TIED TO THE SIZE OF `.text`, which is what moved it last and is
# now the BINDING constraint rather than the band.** The band is a property of
# the geometries; what has to be true as well is that the offset names a live
# byte, and `.text` is the only section that reaches it - `.bss` is `nobits`,
# so from the end of `.text` to `COLD_START` the file is ZEROS. A canary in
# that padding is not merely uninformative, it is INERT in the one direction
# that matters: every word in it equals its neighbour a sector away, so a read
# that flipped heads early compares equal and the canary PASSES. The kernel
# size pass shrank `.text` 52,916 -> 50,207 and slid 51200 out of the code and
# into that padding with no line of the boot path edited - the third distinct
# way this constant has gone wrong, after drifting against BOOT2_SECS and
# against the set of geometries, and the second one where a merge that
# conflicted in no file produced it. tests/unit/t_canary.py's neighbour test
# is what caught it.
#
# **AND THE DESIGN CHANGE THE LAST PARAGRAPH ASKED FOR HAS BEEN TAKEN.** This
# constant was 50176 - file sector 98 + BOOT2_SECS - with the sentence
# "`.text` MAY NOT FALL BELOW 50,178 BYTES ... and the answer then is a design
# change, not a new number" written here in capitals. `.text` was 50,607, so
# that was 429 bytes of headroom, and the kernel size pass that read it takes
# ~600. THE DESIGN CHANGE IS THAT THERE IS ONE BLOB LENGTH NOW.
#
# The band is the intersection over the four shipped geometries, and it is
# ALSO an intersection over the blob lengths, because the file sector is the
# memory offset plus BOOT2_SECS. Re-derived from the four BPBs, in MEMORY
# sectors:
#
#   crossing on all four, BOOT2_SECS = 8    : 13, 49, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102
#   crossing on all four, BOOT2_SECS = 9    : 12, 48, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101
#   both, which is what the old value needed : 98, 99, 100, 101
#
# So while SPLSTARS' blob was a sector longer, the only offsets legal at all
# were four sectors at the very TOP of `.text` - the part a size pass eats
# first - and 98 was the bottom of them. That is the whole reason this constant
# ran out of room, and retiring BOOT2_SECS_STARS (SPEC.md 15.3.8.5) is what
# gives it back: with one length the band is seven sectors wide and reaches
# memory 6,656.
#
# Dock setup uses a nine-sector blob (SPEC.md 30.5), so the canary moves
# to 6144: memory sector 12, file sector **12 + BOOT2_SECS** = 21. It is a LONE
# sector rather than a run of five, which is what the old value's paragraph
# preferred - a lone sector was not legal at all while there were two blob
# lengths - and the trade is deliberate: margin against a BPB that moves is
# worth less than margin against `.text`, because a geometry change is a
# decision somebody takes and `.text` shrinks whenever anyone tidies anything.
# `.text` may now fall to **6,146** before this constant needs looking at
# again, against 50,178 before; it is 50,607 today. It is inside the first
# 64KB, so the compare still reuses the ES the handoff already loads, and the
# word is still the same for every geometry because KERNEL.SYS is one file.
# tests/unit/t_canary.py re-derives every line of the table above from the
# shipped images themselves and checks the word against BOTH its neighbours -
# and it now refuses a second blob length outright rather than silently
# describing only the default one.
#
# THE OLD "stays below bootdiag's 48-sector payload" RULE IS GONE, and it was
# already dead when it was written down: SPEC.md 2.9 moved the canary into
# STAGE 2, and every diagnostic that carries a short payload - bootdiagx,
# rdiag, comscan, lptlink - is built -DFLAT_PAYLOAD, which jumps straight to
# KERNEL_SEG:0 and never enters stage 2 at all. There has been no canary on
# those disks for either value of this constant. What still holds is the
# runtime fence one line down, and it is enough on its own: a payload shorter
# than this offset gets no -DKSIG, boot/boot.asm's `%define KSIG 0` applies,
# and stage 2's `cmp word [b2_ksig], 0` skips the compare.
# SPEC.md 6.0.1 took the blob to TEN sectors, and the probe moved one memory
# sector down with it - 5632, memory sector 11, file sector 11 + 10 = 21, the
# same file sector - so the band argument above is untouched.
KSIG_OFF := 5632
#
# A PAYLOAD SHORTER THAN THE OFFSET DEFINES NO KSIG AT ALL, and that is the
# whole of this line's second job. It used to answer 0, and a fabricated zero is
# worse than no signature: boot/boot.asm's %error only fires when KSIG is
# UNDEFINED, so a 0 sails straight through it, and uninitialised RAM at that
# offset reading back as 0 then makes the canary PASS - which publishes
# `boot_cylrun` for a head crossing that nothing ever verified. Omitting the
# -D instead routes the impossible case (an image long enough to compile the
# canary in, short enough to have no word there) to that %error, and leaves the
# ORDINARY short payload - comscan, lptlink - building silently, because the
# sector's own gate compiles no canary for it to need. The gate is the other
# half of the same fence: KERNEL_SECTORS > KSIG_OFF/512, not > 32, so the

#
# AND IT REFUSES A KERNEL SHORTER THAN THE OFFSET. KSIGDEF above prints nothing
# for a short payload on purpose; this one MUST NOT, because boot/boot.asm
# defaults KSIG to 0 and 0 means NO CANARY - so a kernel that came out shorter
# than KSIG_OFF (a cut-down build, a broken split) would boot with the check
# silently switched off. The refusal is two-sided: the message goes to stderr

# rather than `--compress` deliberately: three of the two dozen are legitimately
# better off plain - C64 has PARTS, HELLO's in-place layout would make the
# loader claim more - and a refusal there has to be a line of output, not a
# stopped build. A per-package --compress stays strict.
#
# **LZ4 IS THE DEFAULT AND SHIPS** (SPEC.md 20.13.5). It was a knob for one
# cycle, tested in the field on the 360KB set, and it is now what every
# shipped floppy carries - so `make` alone builds the compressed disks and
# `make PKGZ=` builds the uncompressed ones. LZB is NOT shipped: it is ten
# points better on ratio and four times slower to expand, and until somebody
# has that trade measured on a 5150 the machine takes the fast one. Its knob
# stays, on both sides (`make PKGZ=lzb COMPRESS=lzb`, or `zset ZFMT=lzb`),
# because the whole point of a second format is that it can be added on top
# later without the disk layout moving.
#
# THE KERNEL HAS TO CARRY THE FORMAT, so pair it: `make PKGZ=lzb COMPRESS=lzb`.
# PKGZ alone with the default kernel gives an apps disk of packages that will
# not open, which reads exactly like a broken loader; `zset` below is the

# COMPRESS's own default is LZ4 too, and that is why LZ4 is the one that got
# to be the default here.

# ...and a stamp so that CHANGING A KNOB rebuilds what it affects. Without it
# make sees an up-to-date kernel.bin, skips it, and boots the PREVIOUS
# adapter - which reads exactly like the probe or the renderer being broken.
# RAMKB is in the key for the same reason and is the sharper case: it touches
# neither boot.asm nor kernel.bin, so nothing at all would rebuild and the
# machine would boot the previous relocation while reporting the new one.
#
# The invalidation runs at PARSE time, not as a rule. A rule that deletes
# kernel.bin is worse than no rule at all: make has already stat'd the target
# by the time the prerequisite's recipe runs, so it can conclude "up to date"
# about a file that recipe just removed, and then build the floppy image from
# a kernel that is not there. Doing it here means the file is simply gone
# before make builds its graph.
#
# ...and $(KNOBS) is WHICH ONES WERE ASKED FOR, for the banner the kernel rule
# prints. It cannot be "is $(VIDDEF) non-empty", which is what it used to be.
# That test WORKED until the kern_small/kern_big split, which started putting
# -DKERN_BIG in VIDDEF unconditionally - exactly one of the two is always
# defined (see the block above) - and from then on the alarm fired on every
# build ever made, naming a row of blank assignments. A warning that is always
# on is a warning nobody reads, and this one exists to stop a knob kernel being
# tested for detection or cut into a release. Worth noticing as a shape: a
# change somewhere else silenced a guard by making it shout.
#
# The variant is deliberately NOT in this list, which is tools/kernsize.py's
# distinction and worth keeping the two files agreed on: KERN_BIG/KERN_SMALL
# are two SHIPPED PRODUCTS (docs/history/KERN-SPLIT-PLAN.md), `make small` builds one
# into a directory of its own and it forces no probe; everything else here
# produces a kernel nobody ships.
#
# EVERY OTHER KNOB IN $(VIDSTAMP) BELOW BELONGS HERE TOO. SNAPAUDIT and
# SCROLLROW were in the stamp and not in this list, so the kernel duly rebuilt
# for them and the banner said nothing about the kernel it had just built -
# each of them changes the binary (see their ifneqs at the top of this file).
# BOOTDIAG feeds BOTH $(BOOTDEF) and $(VIDDEF) - the sector's checksum report
# (SPEC.md 2.9.7) and stage 2's hex printer, which live in different binaries
# since 2.9 moved the loader. It fed VIDDEF alone for a while and the sector's
# half simply did not assemble. The stamp deletes boot.bin/boot360.bin - but only once BOOTDIAG is
# IN the stamp, which for a long time it was not. The stamp deletes nothing
# unless its own NAME changes, so `make BOOTDIAG=1` reused whatever boot.bin
# was already there and the next plain `make` reused the diagnostic one. See
# the note above $(VIDSTAMP) below.
#
# AND IT IS NOT ONLY THE BANNER ANY MORE. `all` runs `test-fast` when this list
# is EMPTY, and the suite resolves every symbol through tools/os88sym.py, which
# re-assembles kernel.asm with no --define and refuses a map that is not
# byte-identical to build/kernel.bin. So a knob in the stamp and NOT in this
# list does not merely go unannounced - it builds its kernel and then FAILS THE
# BUILD on api-abi. KERN_SMALL was the sharp one: `make KERN_SMALL=1` is the
# second build CLAUDE.md asks for after every change, and it exited 1.

# binds it is guard 2, the 64KB segment, which nobody can raise. KERN_SMALL is
# filtered out because it is not a diagnostic - it is the SHIPPED small-machine
# kernel, with a budget of its own that it stays inside.
#
# It is derived from $(KNOBS) rather than listed, which is the whole point: the
# five %ifdefs this replaced were added one at a time, each after a diagnostic
# that would not assemble. tools/os88sym.py derives the same thing, so a tool
# re-assembling a knob kernel for its symbol map gets the same answer.
# ...and NOHEDGE, which reaches SAVER.DRV and not one kernel byte, so it is in
# $(KNOBS) for the matrix and NOT in $(VIDSTAMP): exempting the kernel for it
# would be the sticky exemption the ETHPROF note below describes.
# ...and NOATBLIT1 for the identical reason one package along: it reaches
# ARTFUL.O88 (SPEC.md 46.4.2) and no kernel byte, so it carries $(ATSTAMP) and
# stays out of $(VIDSTAMP). The two are the whole of the package-only class.
# ...and KERN_EMU joins KERN_SMALL in the exemption, for KERN_SMALL's exact
# reason: it is not a diagnostic, it is the SHIPPED emulator kernel, and it
# stays inside kern_big's budget rather than being excused from it. Getting
# this wrong is silent in the useful direction and loud in the other - a

# SKIPS GUARD 1, the KERN_BUDGET footprint check (kernel.asm). Outside the

# kernel.kz.json AND boothd.bin are on it for a reason of their own (SPEC.md
# 2.9.13): the json is what tools/os88sym.py reads to learn a packed kernel's
# four defines, so a stale one describes a kernel that is no longer there and
# every symbol lookup in the tree refuses; and boothd.bin carries KZ_RPARA and
# KZ_HD as immediates, so it is as build-specific as the two boot sectors
# above it.
#
# kernel-full.bin AND the two on-demand modules are on that list, and for most
# of this Makefile's life they were not - which made the whole stamp ineffective
# for the kernel that actually SHIPS. kernel.bin is not assembled from source:
# os88mod.py splits it, ctrl.drv, format.drv and clone.drv out of kernel-full.bin (SPEC.md
# 2.8), and kernel-full.bin depends on the SOURCES alone. A knob changes the
# command line and no source, so deleting only kernel.bin re-ran the split on
# the PREVIOUS knob's kernel-full.bin - so `make VIDEO=cga` after a plain build
# shipped a KERNEL.SYS and two .drv files with no CGA in them, silently, which
# is the exact failure the stamp exists to prevent and reads as the feature
# under test being broken.
#
# **FOUND TWICE, INDEPENDENTLY, FROM TWO DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS**, which is worth
# keeping because neither symptom points at the stamp. One was an incremental
# plain rebuild after `make SNAPAUDIT=1` differing from a clean one by 39,504
# bytes; the other was `make FDDABSENT=1` producing a kernel with none of the
# knob's bytes in it, while the knob's A/B duly "passed" by comparing a build
# against itself.
#
# **kernsize.py cannot catch this and will actively mislead you**: it
# re-assembles the kernel ITSELF with $(VIDDEF), so it reports the sizes of a
# binary the build did not produce - a 65-byte knob was reported for a kernel
# that did not contain it. os88sym.py is the tool that does catch it, because
# it asserts byte-identity against build/kernel.bin and REFUSES rather than
# answering. The check that never lies is to look for the knob's own bytes in
# the artifact.

# --- the build number the About box shows (SPEC.md 14.2) ---------------------
#
# A GENERATED include, like $(ASSOCICO) and $(FONTINC) below, and generated the
# same way for the same reason: `-I $(BUILD)/` on the kernel rule finds it, so
# tools/kernsize.py and tools/os88sym.py - which re-assemble the kernel
# themselves and pass that same -I - keep working with no argument of their
# own. A -D in $(VIDDEF) would have been shorter and would have broken
# os88sym.py for every session that did not know to repeat it: it asserts
# byte-identity with build/kernel.bin, so a missing define reads as "the map
# describes a DIFFERENT kernel" rather than as a forgotten flag.
#
# It runs at PARSE time and not as a rule, because the thing it depends on is
# not a file: HEAD moves when you commit and no tracked file's mtime moves
# with it, so a rule would never fire and the image would carry the previous
# build's number - the VIDSTAMP trap one paragraph up, with a number instead
# of an adapter. buildnum.py rewrites the file only when the number actually
# changed, so this costs an up-to-date tree nothing; when it does change,
# kernel.bin's ordinary prerequisite does the rest and no stamp is needed.
#
# $(BUILDNUM) is the number itself for the banner on the kernel rule. It is
# 0 when the build could not determine it (no git, or a shallow clone, where
# the count is silently short - see buildnum.py), and 0 means the About box
# shows the version line exactly as it always did.

# recorder.o88 is here for the SECOND half of that sentence and not the first
# (SPEC.md 35.1). It is not an instrument - it was a shipped application until
# it came off the apps disk - and the arrangement is what keeps SPEC.md 35
# describing a package that still assembles. Without this line RECORDER.O88 is
# named by no target `all` reaches at all, and the way that fails is the way
# every entry in this comment fails: silently, months later, when somebody
# changes apps/os88ui.inc and the one caller nothing builds stops matching it.
#
# pacman.o88 WAS HERE AND IS RETIRED (SPEC.md 89.12, apps/RETIRED.txt). It was
# here as recorder's case - a package `all` must keep BUILDING after it came
# off the disk lists, so that an edit to apps/os88ui.inc cannot break its only
# caller unseen - and it is off this line now because a retired package is not
# owed that: nothing is going to change under it, and `make pacman` is what
# builds the record when somebody wants to look at it.
#
# The history is worth keeping, because it is the failure the rest of this
# comment is about. PACMAN came off the disk lists "while DOT DELIRIUM is
# developed", and the sentence it was written with - "`make` still BUILDS
# build/pacman.o88 - it is only the disk lists this leaves" - stopped being
# true in the same commit, because $(BUILD)/pacman.o88 was in APPS_GAMES and
# nothing else named it. A PR-cycle byte audit found it by building three
# commits clean and noticing the artefact had vanished from one of them
# (docs/reports/PR-CYCLE-ACCOUNTING-2026-09-11.md 6) - arithmetic, months
# before anybody would have looked. THAT is why the removal now goes through
# a registry with a gate on it rather than through a comment: the same edit
# also left the package on the live volume, where it shipped for the whole
# time it was "off the disks", and nothing said so.
#
# hello.o88 is here for that same half and the case is STRONGER than
# RECORDER's (SPEC.md 27.0). It came off every floppy there is by the owner's
# decision - it is the SDK's worked example rather than an application - and
# a worked example that stops assembling is worse than an application that
# does, because every new package is written by copying it and the copy is
# what tells you. It is also not only `all` that would notice late: three
# things read build/hello.o88 out of build/ rather than off a disk -
# build/pkgrun.img (SPEC.md 21.5's OSAPI_PKG_START gate compares the loaded
# bytes against that exact file), tests/unit/t_wire.py's fixture archives and
# tests/unit/t_lzfmt.py's round trip - and all three are soak rows that would
# fail naming a missing file rather than naming this line.
#
# The Weave demo bundles ride `all` for wire's reason, one stage earlier: the
# runtime is a C package that `all` does not build (`make weave`), so the pack
# itself - three demo sources through tools/weavesim.py, behind its
# --selfcheck stamp - is what keeps the .WAB contract exercised on every
# build, and the fast tier's `wab` row reads the result back with an
# independent second implementation. Pure python3, host-side; the same three
# bundles ride `make weavedisk`'s WEAVE/ folder. The rules are below, next to
# wire's.

# The regression suite (tools/os88test.py, tests/suite.py). Three tiers:
#
#   test-fast   ~2s, host-side only, and it runs in the DEFAULT BUILD for
#               checkdocs' reason one rule up - a gate nobody types is a gate
#               that accumulates findings. It reads what the build just
#               produced (the kernel binary, the packages, the images) and
#               checks the invariants that break SILENTLY: the API table
#               against the SDK, a constant mirrored in two files, the FAT12
#               structure of all nine floppies, unreachable code, and that
#               every test in tests/ is registered somewhere.
#
#   test-full   ~2 minutes. Adds the knob kernels and kern_small - every
#               configuration `all` does not build - and the emulator smoke
#               test. NOT a per-commit gate: it answers a question about the
#               WHOLE TREE, so it is run when major work first reaches the
#               integration branch and again when another large round lands
#               there - never on every commit of a feature branch, never on a
#               minor bugfix, a documentation commit or a build-number bump.
#
#   test-soak   No budget, and nearly two hours whole. The other sixty-odd
#               gates in tests/, which are one subject each. The WHOLE tier
#               is for the end of extensive kernel surgery, or a request;
#               anything less runs the SUBJECT instead, which is minutes:
#               `python3 tools/os88test.py soak -k disp*`.
#
# docs/TESTING.md's `When to run which tier` is the authority on all three,
# and CLAUDE.md's Testing section is its short form.
#
# It is a real prerequisite list rather than a recipe line on `all` so that
# `make -j` cannot start it before the images it reads are finished.

# check of its own, before it builds anything. Nothing that produces a SHIPPED
# byte may set it, which is why it is not in $(KNOBS) and not in the stamp: it

# the blob's kz_hd in five bytes. `NOKZIP=1` is the only thing keeping the
# unpacked arm of any of that assembling.
#
# IT IS A TWO-PASS BUILD, and it has to be: the loader is told the packed
# sector count and how far up the tail lands, and neither exists until the

# nothing. That last figure is the `accrued` line and it is deliberately the

# EVERY boot.asm rule depends on the MAKEFILE, and that is not tidiness. The
# sector's KSIG_OFF, KSIG and KERNEL_SECTORS are injected on the command line
# and appear nowhere in boot/boot.asm, so moving the canary (SPEC.md 18.93.1)
# left `make` looking at an up-to-date boot360.bin and shipping the OLD offset.
# It reads exactly like the canary not working, and cost a test round to find.
# HEAP_PARA - THE HEAP FLOOR, HANDED TO THE SECTOR (SPEC.md 2.7.1). The
# .nomem refusal asks whether stage 2's blob fits at HEAP_SEG under the 2,560
# bytes we keep live at the ceiling, and `kend` is that floor in paragraphs.
# It cannot be derived from kernel.bin - LOW_PARA is a nobits size that is not
# in the file - and it cannot be a constant in boot/boot.asm, which is
# assembled before the kernel it boots is measured.
#
# This is BOOTHD_DEFS' value by another name: boot/boothd.asm has taken
# BLOB_SEG from the same `kseg + ksize/16` since SPEC.md 2.9.9, and `kend` is
# what kernsize calls it. Both sectors now ask one tool one question.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE COPIED FROM THAT RULE ON PURPOSE, both of them scars.
# $(VIDDEF) is passed to kernsize because it re-ASSEMBLES the kernel to
# measure it, so --json with no defines describes the SHIPPED kernel whatever
# is in build/ - a kern_small sector would otherwise be told kern_big's floor
# and refuse machines kern_small runs on. And the extraction is ITS OWN STEP
# rather than a $$(python3 ...) inside the nasm line, because that throws the
# interpreter's exit status away: a refusal arrives as an empty string and is
# reported by the assembler, about a symbol, several lines further on.
#
# IT IS ONE VALUE AGAIN. A B2_TAIL rode beside it for one commit, because the
# blob used to be read to the top of RAM and copy itself down, and the far
# jump at the end of that copy had to survive being copied over. Reading the
# blob to HEAP_SEG in the first place retires the copy and the constant with

# BOOTDIAG (SPEC.md 2.9.10) - WHY does this BIOS answer `Disk error` on boot
#
# A handful of 86Box BIOSes have refused to boot this OS since the first
# commit, and every one of them says the same eleven characters and stops.
# `Disk error` means "int 13h set carry three times running" and nothing else,
# so it narrows nothing: the loader has been rewritten four times underneath
# that string. This asks the machine instead - the BIOS's identity, the DL it
# handed over, its diskette parameter table and whether our replacement stays
# installed, whether the RAM stage 1 relocates into is there AND stays there,
# and int 13h's answer to each of the eight read shapes the loader uses, every
# one checked against the DATA rather than against the carry flag.
#
# THE TWO IMAGES ARE THE EXPERIMENT, and neither alone is:
#
#   build/bootdiag*.img   the payload behind tests/bootdiag/bdboot.asm, a
#                         loader that depends on NONE of the things under test
#                         - one sector an int 13h, no relocation, no int 1Eh
#                         patch, and a DL fallback. If the machine can read a
#                         single sector this boots and prints the report.
#   build/bootdiagx*.img  the SAME payload behind the SHIPPED boot/boot.asm,
#                         which relocates, patches the table and reads whole
#                         tracks. Identical bytes above the boot sector, so
#                         one booting and the other not is a one-bit answer
#                         that no amount of reading the source gives.

# The system disk is a FAT12 volume with the kernel in its RESERVED AREA
# (SPEC.md 19.3). The boot sector still reads LBA 1..K raw - reserved sectors
# belong to the boot loader by definition - and everything after them is an
# ordinary file system, so drive A: mounts, browses and WRITES like the apps
# disk. That is what gives drivers a place to live and settings a place to be
# kept (SPEC.md 51).
#
# DRIVERS is the list, one .drv per line, root-level: the kernel resolves them
# by name in the volume's current directory and the file manager shows them.
#
# SYSAPPS rides beside them: applications the KERNEL loads by name off A:
# rather than by double-click (SPEC.md 28). Only the Task Manager so far,
# which the chip menu opens - so it has to be on the disk in drive A:.
#
# It is on the APPS disk TOO, for the SINGLE-FLOPPY machine (SPEC.md 28.1):
# there, swapping to the apps disk makes it A:, and the chip menu would
# otherwise stop working the moment the user went to look for a program. Same
# file, different attributes - on the system disk it is read-only
# (SPEC.md 19.6), on the apps disk it is an ordinary file, because that disk
# is the user's.
#
# It lives in SYSTEM/ on both, which is what SYSAPPSARGS says and what
# ui_tm_open looks for (SPEC.md 28.3). Kernel machinery in a folder of its
# own, so the root of a disk is the user's files - and the two disks agree,
# because the chip menu cannot know which of them is in the drive.
# RECURSIVE (`=`, not `:=`), because the on-demand modules appended below are
# per BUILD DIRECTORY (SPEC.md 2.8.2) and a rule that builds a kernel outside
# $(BUILD) overrides KMODDIR for itself - which a simply-expanded DRIVERS
# would have baked in at parse time.
DRIVERS = $(BUILD)/sound.drv $(BUILD)/hdd.drv $(BUILD)/net.drv
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/ramdisk.drv $(BUILD)/ether.drv
# ...and the RAM disk's on-demand half, which rides every disk the drivers do
# but is NOT one of them: nothing puts it in drv_tab, the Drivers page never
# lists it, and only RAMDISK.DRV ever loads it (SPEC.md 62.9.9)
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/rampage.drv
# ...and the hard-disk driver's on-demand half, which rides every disk the
# drivers do but is NOT one of them: nothing puts it in drv_tab, the Drivers
# page never lists it, and only HDD.DRV ever loads it (SPEC.md 52.11)
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/hddtool.drv
# ...and the store above 1MB (SPEC.md 41.12), which is an overlay for the same
# reason and rides every KERN_BIG disk the same way: no drv_tab row, no
# Drivers-page tick, no SYSTEM.CFG bit. The kernel's own boot sniff decides
# whether to read it, so a machine with no memory up there never touches this
# file - and kern_small filters it back out again ($(SMALLDRIVERS) below),
# because SPEC.md 41.11 took the whole feature out of that kernel and nothing
# in it can name, read or load the file
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/xmem.drv
# ...and the animated screen saver (SPEC.md 79), which is an overlay for the
# same reasons and rides every KERN_BIG disk the same way: no drv_tab row, no
# Drivers-page tick, no SYSTEM.CFG bit of its own. blank.inc reads it when the
# idle period runs out and frees it when the session ends, and a machine that
# cannot read it blanks the video signal instead - so a disk without this file
# is a working machine with the old screen blanker on it. kern_small filters it
# back out ($(SMALLDRIVERS) below): drv_load_at, its only loader, is inside
# %ifdef KERN_BIG and nothing on that kernel can name the file
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/saver.drv
# ...and SPEC.md 9.12's CH375 USB mouse, the Book8088's. A drv_tab row with a
# SYSTEM.CFG bit (6) and not wanted by default, so a disk that carries it
# costs a machine without the chip one directory slot and nothing read. On
# every kern_big disk, and kern_small's $(SMALLDRIVERS) is a restatement that
# never held it
DRIVERS += $(BUILD)/usbmouse.drv
# ...and SPEC.md 9.11's absolute pointer is NOT HERE, which is the one entry
# in this list that is an absence. Its code is 386 instructions and the target
# machine is an 8088, so it is the one file in the tree that MUST NOT BE
# EXECUTED on the machine the project is calibrated against - and unlike XMEM
# and the saver, whose loaders are resident on kern_big and decide per machine,
# NOTHING ON A kern_big DISK CAN NAME IT since SPEC.md 9.11.7: the row, the
# gate byte, the dispatch and vmm_boot_x are all inside %ifdef KERN_EMU now.
# A driver no resident code can name is not "unused" on the disk, it is
# unreachable, and SPEC.md 24.5's rule is then the whole answer: 521 bytes and
# one directory slot of a 360KB system disk that had 17 of 354 clusters left.
# It rides $(EMUDRIVERS) instead - `make emu` - and the vmmousetest image.
# ...and the ON-DEMAND KERNEL MODULES (SPEC.md 2.8), which are neither a driver
# nor an overlay. Both of those are SELF-CONTAINED images with a dispatcher and
# an ABI; a module is this kernel's OWN CODE, cut out of the assembled binary by
# tools/os88mod.py, naming `cp_sel` and `dsk_secbuf` at the addresses this build
# put them at. They are .DRV for one reason: os88disk.py's sys_attr stamps
# anything ending DRV read-only+hidden+system by EXTENSION (SPEC.md 19.6), the
# installer's `*.DRV` copy rule picks them up, and ld_check_hdr refuses to launch
# one. Nothing lists them as drivers.
#
# LAST, because $(KMODS) is the only entry that reads $(KMODDIR), which the
# non-default image rules override per target - which is also why DRIVERS is a
# recursive `=` and not a `:=`.
DRIVERS += $(KMODS) $(BIGMODS)

# --- ...and what the EMULATOR disks carry on top (SPEC.md 9.11.7) -------------
# $(DRIVERS) PLUS the absolute pointer, and that direction is the point: this
# is an ADDITION to the shipped set, where $(SMALLDRIVERS) below is a
# restatement from nothing. Both spellings are chosen rather than inherited.
#
# kern_emu is kern_big with one feature switched on, so its disk is the big
# disk with one file added, and a driver added to $(DRIVERS) tomorrow should
# appear here too - which an `=` addition gives for free and a hand-written
# list would not. kern_small's case is the opposite one (a driver added
# tomorrow must NOT reach that disk), which is why the two are written
# differently and why neither should be made to look like the other.
#
# RECURSIVE for $(DRIVERS)' own reason: $(KMODS) inside it reads $(KMODDIR),
# which the emu image rule overrides per target so the on-demand kernel
# modules come out of the emu kernel and not the shipped one.
EMUDRIVERS = $(DRIVERS) $(BUILD)/vmmouse.drv

# ...and where that build goes. UP HERE WITH $(EMUDRIVERS) rather than down
# with `make emu`, where $(SMALLDIR) sits beside `make small`, because the
# vmmouse GATE disk needs it some 3,500 lines earlier: `$(BUILD)/vmmouse.img:
# KMODDIR := $(EMUDIR)` is a target-specific `:=`, evaluated where it is read,
# so a definition below it expands to nothing and the gate silently takes the
# SHIPPED kernel's modules. See `make emu` for what the directory is for.
EMUDIR := $(BUILD)/emuk

# ...and THE WIRE (SPEC.md 92) beside it, which is a SYSAPPS package and not
# one of $(CORE_TOOLS) below. The distinction is not size: a core package is a
# second copy of something that also rides the apps disk, in the folder it
# occupies over there; the Wire is in SYSTEM/, it is launched BY NAME by the
# kernel (the desktop zone, SPEC.md 26), and it is on all FOUR geometries where
# the core six are on three. It is also the only copy - a program whose whole
# subject is fetching software off the network belongs on the disk the machine
# booted from, and nowhere else.
#
# **THE 360KB SYSTEM DISK IS THE BINDING ONE**, and the arithmetic is
# re-stated here because the comment two hundred lines below still says the
# figure it had when Browser and Telnet went on (see there). Measured with
# `python3 tools/os88disk.py --verify build/os8088-360.img`: 354 clusters of
# 1,024 bytes, 337 in use before this and 17 free. THEWIRE.O88 is ~10.2KB, so
# 10 clusters, and what is left is 7 - about 7KB. SPEC.md 92.11 keeps the
# package under 12,288 bytes for exactly that margin, and os88disk.py refusing
# the image is the enforcement rather than this comment.
SYSAPPS := $(BUILD)/taskmgr.o88 $(BUILD)/thewire.o88
SYSAPPSARGS := $(addprefix SYSTEM:,$(SYSAPPS))

# --- ...and DOS (SPEC.md 96) is in the system disk's APPS/, not SYSTEM/ ------
# It belongs on the system disk for THE WIRE's reason one step along: a .COM
# can be sitting on ANY floppy, so the program that runs one belongs on the
# disk the machine booted from, and the 360KB apps disk has no room to double
# it. What it may NOT be is a SYSAPPS package in SYSTEM/, and the reason is
# SPEC.md 54.4.2: assoc_locate's four rungs are the hint, the document's own
# directory, a volume's ROOT and the APPS or GAMES folder - there is no rung
# that looks in SYSTEM/. APPS/ is rung 4, and assoc_dfold's built-in row for
# DOS says 1, which is what makes the rung land there.
#
# **AND IT IS THE PARTED ONE, ON A MEASUREMENT THAT MOVED** (SPEC.md 96.40.3,
# 96.44.5). Pointing this at $(BUILD)/kdos/DOS.O88 makes the Memory page's
# third arm - `Give DOS the whole machine`, SPEC.md 96.36 - LIVE on the
# ordinary system disks rather than on a gate disk, because `dos_mem_whole`
# greys the arm on the one fact it can check: whether the package it is
# running from carries kern_dos as a part.
#
# IT WAS TRIED ONCE AND REFUSED, and what was refused was a DIFFERENT PACKAGE.
# §96.44.4's two-piece shape made the BOX the image, and os88pkg.py refuses
# `--compress` beside parts - a part's offset is measured from the image - so
# DOS.O88 went 26,723 to 57,272 RAW bytes: 30 of the 360KB system disk's 50
# free clusters, and +932 ms on every launch (23 int 13h / 125 sectors / 2,690
# ms plain against 25 / 146 / 3,622). Twelve soak rows that sat about two
# seconds inside a fifteen-second wait went red at once.
#
# §96.44.5's FOUR pieces are what that refusal asked for: a 2,092-byte raw
# loader in front of three COMPRESSED parts, two of them OP_LAZY. MEASURED on
# os8088_5150_cga_gla, the same click on the same machine, first launch of a
# fresh boot:
#
#   |            | file   | 360KB clusters | reads | sectors | launch  |
#   |------------|-------:|---------------:|------:|--------:|--------:|
#   | plain      | 26,901 |            304 |     4 |      53 | 4,200ms |
#   | four-piece | 44,337 |            321 |     6 |      69 | 4,950ms |
#
# So the price of the capability being live is **17 clusters and +750 ms**,
# against the 30 and +932 that were refused - and 33 clusters are still free.
# THE +750 IS NOT A ROUNDING OF THE +932 AND DOES NOT GO AWAY: the two extra
# reads are the loader's own image and part 1, the INT 21h core, which
# `dsl_core` fetches at launch and drops again (apps/dos/dosload.asm). Part 1
# is OP_LAZY precisely so `op_size` does not claim room for it in the carve,
# so the read is the RAM it buys and not an oversight.
#
# ONE VARIABLE EITHER WAY, and the plain package is still built: $(ASSOCICO)
# reduces its icon on the host, and pointing THAT at the parted package would
# hang the kernel's own generated include off kerndos.bin, which is assembled
# over the kernel's sources. Both roots %include apps/dos/dosicon.inc, so the
# icon and the association block cannot drift.
SYSROOT := $(BUILD)/kdos/DOS.O88
SYSROOTARG := APPS:$(BUILD)/kdos/DOS.O88
# ...and the SUBSET an APPS disk carries: the Task Manager alone, for the
# single-floppy machine above. THEWIRE.O88 is on NO apps disk (CLAUDE.md,
# SPEC.md 92.11): the desktop zone launches it out of the BOOT volume's
# SYSTEM/ (SPEC.md 26.7), so a copy on B: is never the one that runs - and the
# 360KB apps disk is full to its last cluster, which is what the copy cost
# when it rode along in #151 and what the archive unpacker (92.13) could not
# have afforded.
APPSYS := $(BUILD)/taskmgr.o88
APPSYSARGS := $(addprefix SYSTEM:,$(APPSYS))

# --- the CORE PACKAGES (SPEC.md 24.3) ----------------------------------------
# Six programs that ride the SYSTEM disk as well as the apps disk, each in
# the folder it already occupies over there. A second copy, never a move:
# APPS_TOOLS and APPS_GAMES below are unchanged and still carry every package
# there is, so a machine that swaps to the apps disk finds everything where
# it was.
#
# Two things are bought, and the second is the reason the list is THESE six:
#
#   1. a one-floppy machine (SPEC.md 28.1) had to eject the disk it booted
#      from before it could open anything at all;
#   2. os88disk.py builds ASSOC.DAT from the packages on the disk it is
#      building (SPEC.md 54.7), so the system disk's cache gains PAINT,
#      NOTEPAD, BROWSER and FONT VIEWER rows naming their folder ON THAT VOLUME
#      - and the first full mount of A: therefore seeds the
#      .TXT/.BMP/.GIF/.HTM hints at A: instead of at a disk that is not in
#      the drive (SPEC.md 54.7.1). That mount used to teach the machine
#      nothing at all, TASKMGR.O88 being the only package on the disk and
#      nothing being associated with it. Mines and Telnet have no
#      association and are here for reason 1 alone; their rows are icon-cache
#      rows, which is what makes APPS/ and GAMES/ on this disk open without a
#      header read per package.
#
# BROWSER IS THE ONE THAT ADDS AN EXTENSION RATHER THAN A HINT: .HTM is not in
# the kernel's own assoc_ext at all (BMP/GIF/TXT/MOD/MD), so the only thing
# that can ever bind it is a volume's ASSOC.DAT naming BROWSER - which means a
# .HTM on the boot disk opened NOTHING until the apps disk had been in the
# drive. Measured: mounting A: takes asc_n 5 -> 7 with an HTM row appearing.
#
# BROWSER and TELNET are core for a reason the first four are not: they are
# the two packages whose whole subject is a machine that is TALKING to
# something. A network machine boots with ETHER.DRV or NET.DRV already up
# (SPEC.md 72.9, 62), and the disk that carries the driver ought to carry the
# two programs that use it - "the link is configured and there is nothing on
# this disk that can speak over it" is a working machine that looks broken.
# Telnet is 4KB and Browser 14KB against this disk's free clusters, which is
# what makes the pair affordable where Tracker's 30KB and the module it exists
# to play are not. **THE FIGURE THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS 60 AND IS STALE** -
# it was true of the disk before those two went on it. Measured rather than
# remembered, with `python3 tools/os88disk.py --verify build/os8088-360.img`:
# 354 clusters of 1,024 bytes, 337 in use and 17 free before the Wire
# (SPEC.md 92.11), 7 after it. A cluster count in a comment is a number that
# goes stale the next time anything ships, so the enforcement is os88disk.py
# refusing an image that does not fit, and this is the arithmetic behind the
# decision rather than a live figure.
#
# NOTHING IN THE KERNEL CHANGED FOR THIS and nothing had to: every mechanism
# it uses already covers "some other volume has this program on it", which is
# what a removable disk is.
#
# DEFINED HERE, beside DRIVERS and SYSAPPS, and not down with APPS_TOOLS -
# which is mechanical and not taste. A rule's prerequisites are expanded where
# the rule is READ, so $(IMG) at the top of this file cannot see a list
# defined 2,000 lines below it: the images would build against whatever .o88
# was already lying in build/, which reads exactly like a stale package rather
# than like a missing dependency. The guard that keeps these on the apps disk
# too is down beside APPS_TOOLS, where both lists exist.

# ...and MEDIA, which every disk carries: it is where a File Open or File
# Save starts (SPEC.md 38.10), so it has to exist on whatever volume the user
# is on. --folder is os88disk's way of saying "this folder, with nothing in
# it" - a folder otherwise exists only because a file named one - and it is
# still what the disks below that carry no media use.
MEDIAFOLDER := --folder MEDIA

# ...and SYSTEM/APPDATA, which every disk that carries an application carries
# too (SPEC.md 19.9). A program's own state - a high-score table, a window
# position, a preference - is not a document, and the file browser is the whole
# of how a user reaches an application: anything sitting in APPS or GAMES that
# is NOT an app is a misclick waiting to happen and one more row to scroll
# past. So it goes here, and the browser's app folders stay applications only.
#
# Built rather than created on demand for the same reason MEDIA is: a folder
# exists only because a file named one, and an application that has to make
# its own would have to handle "the disk is full" on a path nobody tests.

# folder open on SOMETHING. The dialog starts in MEDIA and a boot floppy had
# nothing to put there, so the first File > Open a new user ever ran showed
# them an empty list on a working machine.
#
# GENERATED, never committed: the artwork is code (tools/os88logo.py), for
# the reason fonts/*.f8 is ASCII art rather than hex - a picture's defects

# for a reason of its own: tools/os88logovid.py needs numpy, and a build
# dependency for a file that changes when somebody redraws the logo is the

# the gate. It rides MEDIA/ with VIDEO.O88 beside it in APPS/ on the system
# disks of 720KB and up and on the live media, so every such boot volume

#
# README.TXT: the user manual, in the root of the system disk, so the machine
# explains itself with no second disk and no host computer to read it on.
#
# Two constraints shape the source file and neither is arbitrary. Note Pad
# wraps by WORD (SPEC.md 27.11), so PROSE is written as one long line per
# paragraph and re-flows to whatever width the window is dragged to. What
# cannot re-flow is everything whose SHAPE is the meaning - the rules under a
# heading, the two-column key tables, the contents list - so those are
# hand-wrapped to 28 columns, one under the 29 that Note Pad's default window
# fits (260px frame, less the border, the 8px margin and the 14px scroll bar,
# over an 8px cell). And the whole file stays under 16KB because that is Note
# Pad's own ceiling (NP_MAXKB): a byte over and it refuses the file outright
# with 'Too big'. tools/checkreadme.py holds both, and runs before the file
# is used.
#
# CRLF is applied HERE rather than committed, so the repository copy stays a
# plain LF text file that diffs and merges normally, and the disk gets the
# DOS line endings a .TXT on a FAT floppy is expected to have (the disks are
# meant to be readable on a DOS PC - SPEC.md 19). The conversion is
# idempotent: LF is normalised out first, so re-running it never doubles a CR.
# --- the TYPEFACES (SPEC.md 6.4/19.8) ----------------------------------------
# One .F88 per family, built from the reviewable art in faces/, and carried in
# SYSTEM/FONTS on the SYSTEM disk. A face is the machine's and not an
# application's - the same thing the kernel's own 8x8 cell is - so a second
# program wanting Charter finds it already there instead of carrying a copy.
# They are DATA: the mount types a directory entry as an application only when
# its extension is O88 (SPEC.md 19), so a .F88 can never be double-clicked
# into the loader.
#
# UNDER SYSTEM/ AND NOT BESIDE IT (SPEC.md 19.8.1). The root of the system
# disk is what the user sees when they open the boot floppy, and a folder of
# files no person opens by hand had no business being one of the four things
# in it. SYSTEM/ is already where the machine's own furniture lives -
# TASKMGR.O88 and APPDATA/ - so the faces join it, and the root loses an entry
# rather than gaining one. os88disk.py needs nothing new for it: a nested
# folder key creates its parents, so SYSTEM/FONTS costs an entry in SYSTEM
# instead of one in the root.
#
# The list is generated from the directory, exactly as SPEC.md 6.2.1's FONT=
# targets are, so a new face is a new file and not an edit here as well.

# 1,498-1,688 bytes, so every one of the ten wasted most of its second
# cluster; packed to 52-65% each is one. What reads them is ty_open, which
# takes an 8KB claim, rounds it to a 512-byte boundary and reads at offset 0
# with OSAPI_FILE_READ - the transparent read's exact shape (20.14.3) - so a
# 'CZ' face arrives expanded and ty_hdrchk runs against the image. The packed
# copy lives in $(BUILD)/faces/ under the SAME basename, because os88disk

# and Note Pad reads it whole through OSAPI_FILE_READ - so SPEC.md 20.14's
# transparent read applies and nothing in np_load changes. TWO ARTEFACTS, and
# the split is not tidiness:
#
#   * $(SYSDOC) is what every FAT volume carries. Compressed when PKGZ is set,
#     IN PLACE at build/readme.txt rather than under $(ZDATA) - the shipped
#     packages are compressed in place too, and tests/unit/t_pkg.py compares
#     every file on every image against the build/ artefact of the same name,
#     so a compressed disk file with a plain twin beside it is a gate failure
#     rather than a naming preference.
#   * $(SYSDOCRAW) is always plain, and the live CD carries it as its
#     host-visible README.TXT (SPEC.md 80.2) - a host that mounts the ISO to
#     copy the raw image off it must be able to read the instructions for
#     doing so, and a 'CZ' blob is not that.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY IS ROOM. checkreadme.py's 16KB limit is np_load's, and
# np_load claims against the UNPACKED size that OSAPI_FILE_FIND reports
# (SPEC.md 20.14.4) - so the manual has the same 1,662 bytes of headroom it
# had before, and rule 2 there still measures the CRLF source, not the file.
SYSDOCRAW := $(BUILD)/readme-plain.txt

# --- WHAT THE 360KB SYSTEM DISK ALONE LEAVES OFF (SPEC.md 24.3) --------------
#
# That geometry is **354 clusters of 1,024 bytes** and it carries the whole
# driver set, both kernel-module sets, the manual, the logo, ten typefaces with
# their licence and the six core packages. It had 352 in use and 2 free before
# SPEC.md 70.9's ANSI-BBS parser, which takes TELNET.O88 from 7 clusters to 10.
#
# **TELNET STAYS, BECAUSE THE XT IS THE MACHINE §24.3's ARGUMENT IS ABOUT.**
# (It stayed until SPEC.md 24.3.1.2, which took it and Browser off this
# geometry on the Wire's test - see SYS360OMIT below. Kept as the record.)
# A network machine's system disk carries the driver, so it should carry the
# programs that use it; a 360KB disk is precisely the machine that has no other
# floppy to swap in. What gives way instead, on THIS GEOMETRY ONLY:
#
#   MINES.O88       a second copy of a GAME. §24.3's argument for the core six
#                   is about programs the boot disk's own drivers make useful,
#                   which Browser and Telnet are and a game is not. It is
#                   untouched on the 720KB, 1.44MB and 1.2MB system disks and
#                   on every apps disk, so nothing is lost anywhere else.
#   JETBRAIN.F88    one of TEN faces, and the largest (1,688 bytes with
#                   COURIER.F88). Nothing names it: `apps/browser` names
#                   `times` and `apps/sheet` names `Helv`, and Sheet is not on
#                   a system disk at all. This geometry still carries
#                   INCONSOL.F88 and ROBOMONO.F88, so it does not lose the
#                   monospace SHAPE, only one family of it.
#   COURIER.F88     **AND THE SAME ARGUMENT AGAIN SINCE SPEC.md 70.11**, which
#                   is why it reads the same: the Zmodem receiver takes
#                   TELNET.O88 from 10 clusters to 14 and this geometry had
#                   four. Courier is the OTHER 1,688-byte face, it is the THIRD
#                   monospace on a disk that keeps INCONSOL.F88 and
#                   ROBOMONO.F88, and nothing on this disk names it - the two
#                   places in the tree that write "Courier" are
#                   apps/texpad/tpexport.inc and apps/word/wdrtf.inc, and both
#                   mean a POSTSCRIPT or RTF font name in a file they are
#                   exporting, not a typeface they load. It is untouched on the
#                   720KB, 1.44MB and 1.2MB system disks and on every apps disk.
#   TALLX.F88       **AND A THIRD TIME, AND IT IS THE LAST.** The receiver
#                   landed at 14,337 bytes, which is ONE byte over fourteen
#                   clusters, and shaving a package to fit a cluster boundary
#                   leaves the next editor nine bytes of headroom and no
#                   warning. So the cluster comes off the disk instead. TALLX
#                   is a DISPLAY face and the smallest of the ten (1,118
#                   bytes); nothing names it either, and this geometry keeps
#                   ARCHIVO, CHARTER, HELV, INCONSOL, NOTO, ROBOMONO and TIMES
#                   - seven of ten, both monospaces, and the two the shipped
#                   packages ask for by name.
#
# **THIS GEOMETRY IS AT 351 OF 354, THREE FREE, AND THE ARGUMENT ABOVE IS NOW
# SPENT.** It has been used three times in two waves and there is no fourth
# face on this disk that nothing names: what is left is the seven a Font menu
# needs to be worth opening. The next feature that grows anything here gives up
# something ELSE - a core package, the manual, the logo - and that is a
# decision for whoever asks for the feature, not another line in this list.
#
# **A FILTER-OUT AND NOT A SECOND LIST**, which is the opposite of $(SMALLOMIT)
# and is right for the opposite reason: kern_small's list says what CANNOT run
# there and must not gain a row by accident, where this one says what a full
# machine is doing without for want of room, and SPEC.md 24.3.1.1 is why it
# is PAINT.O88 - the largest package the Wire can give back, where a face is
# the one thing that geometry could never recover. A package added to
# $(COREAPPS) tomorrow SHOULD appear here and be refused by os88disk if it does
# not fit, which is the failure everybody wants.
# **EMPTY ON THIS BRANCH, AND MEASURED.** The list arrived from `main` with
# PAINT.O88 in it because that geometry was at 351 of 354 there. Here every
# package, driver, module, face and the manual is lz4-packed (SPEC.md 20.13)
# and the KERNEL is too (2.9.13), so the same disk builds with PAINT.O88 on it
# at **277 of 354 - 77 spare** - against 255 with it filtered out. Keeping
# the filter would have dropped PAINT.O88 off a disk this branch already
# shipped it on, which is a regression the merge would have caused
# rather than a decision anyone took. The MACHINERY stays: it is where
# the next thing that grows this geometry gives something up, and os88disk.py
# refusing the image is the enforcement.
#
# **AND BROWSER AND TELNET ARE WHAT IT GIVES UP NOW** (SPEC.md 24.3.1.2). The
# disk reached 350 of 354 - four clusters free - and the owner took them both
# off on 24.3.1.1's test: can the machine get it BACK. A machine that can use
# either one has a link up, and a machine with a link up has THE WIRE, which
# stays in SYSTEM/ on this disk and whose catalog carries both. So the "a
# network machine's system disk should carry the programs that use its
# driver" argument further up is spent at this geometry: the one network
# program it carries is the one that fetches the others. Both stay on the
# 720KB, 1.44MB and 1.2MB system disks and on every apps disk, and
# BROWSER.HTM is in MEDIA/ on build/apps360.img beside the browser that
# opens it - this disk never carried the page. The 360KB gate disks
# (ether360, thewire360, the usbm pair) take the same list; every network
# row opens the browser off B:.

# (SPEC.md 2.8) would have to keep all of it in the kernel's own `.text`. Here

# the field's column-0 shimmer GONE, on 86Box and on the 5150 both: 86Box's
# plain Hercules renderer copies an attenuated version of what stands at column
# 719 onto column 0 of the row BELOW it (79.5.9 - one row down, which is why it
# is the display's and not this kernel's), so the mode reserves SV_HEDGE = 8
# pixels at the right edge and never lights them, leaving the copy nothing to
# carry. What it costs the picture is eight columns of 720 that the sea is
# already black in, and what it costs the machine is nothing measurable - the

#              per-row dispatch (SPEC.md 46.4.3). The A/B for the composer.
# NOATWALK=1   put at_relayout's .findnl walk back - a whole extra pass over
#              the edited paragraph through at_getb, to find a newline
#              at_scan then rediscovers (SPEC.md 46.3.1).
# NOATSBAR=1   redraw the WHOLE scroll bar on every call, whatever changed -
#              21 far calls and ~1,226 scan-line setups (SPEC.md 46.4.4).
# NOATROW=1    keep at_glyph's scaled row in at_grow's four bss bytes, so the
#              shear read-modify-writes them and .vrep re-reads them on every
#              repeat (SPEC.md 46.4.5).
# NOATBLANK=1  compose a SPACE like any other glyph - eight rows of fetch,
#              complement and store over ground already laid (SPEC.md 46.4.6).
# NOATPLAIN=1  run every Writer-mode line through at_parse's styled FSM, even
#              one with no markup in it at all (SPEC.md 46.4.7).
# NOATCX=1     make at_caret_on reach the caret's x through a whole at_parse,
#              rather than arithmetically on a plain line (SPEC.md 46.4.8).
# NOATRESPAN=1 put at_respan back - a SECOND walk of every wrapped visual line
#              to re-derive a nibble the first walk already had (SPEC.md
#              46.3.2).
# NOATFETCH=1  send at_scan's per-character fetch back through at_getb - a
#              near call that banks ES, reloads it from [at_dseg], tests the
#              gap and pops ES, for ONE byte (SPEC.md 46.3.3).
# NOATCELL=1   compose every cell through a CALL to at_glyph, seven register
#              banks and a per-cell strip-cursor computation, even on a plain
#              scale-1 line where none of it can differ (SPEC.md 46.4.9).
# NOATTAIL=1   erase the WHOLE region before a whole-view repaint, the way
#              at_draw_text and at_redraw_below both did, and then draw an
#              opaque full-width line into every row of it - PERFORMANCE.md's
#              second rule broken twice, and 115 ms of a 250 ms repaint on a
#              Hercules (SPEC.md 46.4.10).
# NOATONE=1    repaint the whole PARAGRAPH on every keystroke, at_rlk lines of

#              wrap provably cannot reach above the caret's line
#              (SPEC.md 46.4.11).
# NOATSU=1     erase a pull-down by REPAINTING the lines it covered, full

# The hard disk's volume boot record (SPEC.md 52.10.2), likewise incbin'ed by
# the driver. NO -DKERNEL_SECTORS: unlike the floppy sectors, this one is
# built long before it knows which kernel it will boot, so the count is a word
# at a pinned offset that the installer patches when it writes the VBR.
# THREE constants come out of the KERNEL's own build, and boothd.asm cannot
# know one of them (SPEC.md 2.9.9): BOOT2_SECS is where `.text` starts in the
# file, BLOB_SEG is the heap floor the blob is read to, and SPL_FSEG is the
# word the sector publishes it in. Deferred into the recipe rather than taken
# at parse time, the way KSIG is, because build/kernel.bin need not exist yet.
#
# BOTH OF THEM FOLLOW THIS BUILD'S KNOBS, and neither did. kernsize.py has a
# --build for exactly this ("a sub-make with BUILD= set needs this") and
# os88sym reads $OS88_DEFINES for the knobs and $OS88_BUILD for the directory,
# which is the mechanism its own comment describes - "a tool that never asked
# for a knob still finds the right map". Without either, `make field` - whose $(FIELDDRV) rebuilds the drivers,
# and so this sector, under $(FIELDKNOBS) - asked a PLAIN map about a
# DISK_COUNTERS kernel, os88sym refused as it should, and both -D options then
# simply VANISHED from the nasm line. What that printed was
# `boot/boothd.asm:228: symbol BLOB_SEG not defined`, which points at the
# sector rather than at the two constants, and it took every field disk down
# with it - cqdiag.img included, the diagnostic floppy for a machine that will
# not start.
# KZ_HD IS THE THIRD SYMBOL OF THE SAME KIND (SPEC.md 2.9.13.5) and it comes
# out of the same map: a blob offset, so os88sym's answer needs no adjusting,
# and it is emitted only under KZIP because the `%ifdef` in boot/boothd.asm is
# the only thing that names it.

# BLOB_SEG follows the SHIPPED kernel's ladder. A kern_small installed to a
# hard disk would have a lower heap floor, so the blob would land a little
# above it - a gap rather than an overlap, because mem_init raises [mem_base]
# over wherever [spl_fseg] says the blob is. Nothing in `all` builds that
# combination.
#
# THE EXTRACTION IS ITS OWN STEP, and that is one half of the same bug.
# `$$(python3 ...)` inside the nasm line throws the interpreter's exit status
# away, so a refusal reached nasm as an EMPTY STRING and the failure was
# reported by the assembler, about a symbol, several lines further on. Run it
# first and let it fail here, where its traceback is the error. It also puts
# the environment where it belongs: the `VAR=x python3 ...` prefix names the
# process that reads it, which a prefix on the old nasm line never could -
# the shell expanded the substitution before nasm ever started.
#
# $OS88_DEFINES IS WHAT MAKES THIS RULE WORK UNDER A KNOB, and without it no
# knob kernel could build an image at all: os88sym re-assembles kernel.asm and
# refuses the map unless the result is byte-identical to the built kernel, so
# `make BOOTPROF=1` (or MOUDIAG=1, or any of them) died here with
# `symbol BLOB_SEG not defined` - the python having raised, printed nothing,
# and left nasm two defines short. The knobs are already in $(VIDDEF); this
# hands the same set to the tool, which is the mechanism os88sym documents.
# $OS88_BUILD is that idea one directory further on: os88sym takes BOTH the -I
# of the generated includes and the image it compares against from there, so a
# `BUILD=<dir>` sub-make - `make field`, `make small`, any knob built into a
# directory of its own - was checking its own map against build/'s PLAIN
# kernel. With no defines at all that check PASSED and the two constants were
# simply wrong: a hard-disk VBR publishing the blob at an offset that build's
# kernel does not use.
#
# **AND $(VIDDEF) IS PASSED TO kernsize TOO, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT WAS SILENT**
# (SPEC.md 52.10.2.1). kernsize re-ASSEMBLES the kernel to measure it and takes
# its defines as arguments, so `--json` with none describes the SHIPPED kernel
# whatever is in build/ - and BLOB_SEG is `kseg + ksize/16`, the heap floor. A
# knob kernel big enough to move KERN_SIZE by a rung therefore got a volume
# boot record that loads its blob to the SHIPPED kernel's heap floor: on top of
# its own image. Its --build says WHICH directory, the argv says WHICH KERNEL,
# and it needs both. The floppy path cannot have this bug at all, stage 2
# publishing the segment it actually relocated itself to.

# The 1.2MB 5.25" HD disk (SPEC.md 19). The geometry of the machine the 720KB
# note above describes from the other side: an AT-class box - 286 and up, or a
# late XT with an HD controller - whose only drive is 5.25". It can read the
# 360KB disk, because a 1.2MB drive reads 360KB media, and that is what such a
# machine has had to boot until now: 354 clusters, no BEVERLY.MOD without a
# disk swap, and OS88NET.COM competing with the games for room. This disk is
# 2,371 clusters of 512 bytes and carries the SAME payload as the 1.44MB one.
#
# It is worth being exact about which machines this is and is not for. A 1.2MB
# drive needs a 500 kbps controller, which is the AT's, so this does NOT boot
# the calibration 5150 - `make xt`'s 360KB pair is still that machine's, and
# always will be (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md). What it replaces is the 360KB disk
# in a 1.2MB drive, which works and is the one combination of media and drive
# in this project that is known to be marginal to WRITE: a 1.2MB drive's head
# is narrower than a 360KB drive's, so a 360KB disk written in one is often
# unreadable in a real 360KB drive afterwards. Booting the geometry the drive
# was sold as sidesteps that entirely.
#
# Its OWN boot sector, unlike the pair above it: 15 spt is a different track
# shape, and boot/boot.asm's whole knowledge of a disk is SPT and HEADS. See

# selecting settings this test has no opinion about.
# **BIT 4 IS THE ETHERNET DRIVER'S AND IS NOT ITS ROW NUMBER.** The driver word
# is one bit per driver by a STABLE assignment (kernel/driver.inc's drv_cfgbit),
# not by table position - which is what let SPEC.md 31.1's reorder move Ethernet
# to row 2 without re-ticking every SYSTEM.CFG in existence. This file is
# therefore also the compatibility test: it is written with the assignment the

# kern_dos in build/os8088*.img - the knob-kernel-in-build/ trap one device
# along (CLAUDE.md, Testing). Deleting $(BUILD)/kdos/DOS.O88 is what un-does

# KERNEL_SEG offset that is kern_dos's image one instruction later - and
# nothing put anything back in its place. Reported off a 386: hold a direction
# key in a game that is busy drawing, the BIOS buffer fills, and the ROM's beep
# is longer than the typematic interval, so the next repeat overflows DURING
# the beep and it never stops.
#
# It is a knob because kern_dos's whole promise is "the machine with no
# operating system on it", and this is a deliberate departure from that -
# MEASURED as such: a real IBM DOS 3.30 leaves `int 09h` at F000:E987 and so

# which is the false green docs/plans/SOAK-PARALLEL.md 6 is about. The rows
# that drove them boot the shipped images instead, which is a WIDER test than
# the one they replace: they now assert what a user has rather than what a
# gate disk was built to have.

# ...AND THE 720KB ONE IS `$(IMG720)`, build/os8088-720.img. The other lane

# image and blitted with gfx_blit4; faces are drawn from the kernel font plus
# 1-bit suit masks, hollow for the red suits on a 1bpp adapter.

# TWO PASSES, AND THE CIRCULARITY IS WHY (SPEC.md 88.10.6.1). `CS_VOCAB_AT` is
# derived from the PROGRAM - the image plus the ZWORD chain, rounded to a
# paragraph - so the claim is what Clear Skies actually needs; but that size is
# only known once skies.asm has assembled, and skies.asm cannot lay out its bss
# until the address is known. So: csworlds at the CEILING (provisional, and it
# always assembles because nothing can be above it), a -DCS_SIZEPROBE assembly
# whose object IS the image followed by one word of CS_BSS, then csworlds again
# with the address read off it.
#
# A DIAG TREE STILL DOES NOT MOVE THE OVERLAY UP BY HAND - it derives its own,
# which is strictly better than the one address every tree shared: $(CSDIAGDEF)
# is passed to the PROBE as well, so -DCSPROBE sizes the overlay against the
# -DCSPROBE image. That is what stopped it assembling at all when the address
# was a shipped constant.
#
# IT DEPENDS ON $(SKIES_SRC) NOW, which is the whole point: touch any source
# the program is built from and the address is measured again. There is no

# THE C TOOLCHAIN (SPEC.md 73) - ON DEMAND: `make cc-smoke`, `make chello`,
#                                           `make cword`, `make cworddisk`
# =============================================================================
# apps/cc/Makefile.inc holds the rules that turn a .c file into an .o88: the
# two new steps (smlrcc -tiny -S, then tools/cc8086.py, which lowers the seven
# non-8086 forms SmallerC emits and REFUSES the C that is silently wrong here
# - SPEC.md 73.6, 73.10) in front of the three steps every assembly package
# already goes through unchanged. Its header asks to be included "anywhere
# after $(BUILD) and $(NASM) are defined"; here also puts it after FILESIZE,
# which its size report uses.
#
# Until this line existed nothing in the tree built any C at all, while three
# files already advertised `make cc-smoke`. That target is real from here.
#
# NOTHING IN `all` REACHES ANY OF IT, in two separate senses and both on
# purpose:
#
#  * THE DEFAULT BUILD DOES NOT NEED THE COMPILER. SmallerC is not in this
#    tree - tools/setup-cc.sh fetches it at a pinned commit into build/cc/,
#    which is gitignored, so no compiler binary and no compiler source is ever
#    committed (SPEC.md 73.1). A clone with nasm and python3 and nothing else
#    builds every floppy this project ships; `make` there prints the one
#    paragraph cc-note holds and exits 0. Every rule below reaches the
#    compiler only through the `cc-toolchain` order-only guard in
#    apps/cc/Makefile.inc, which sets up missing compiler binaries before
#    the compilation starts.
#
#  * CWORD DOES NOT RIDE THE SHIPPED APPS DISKS. It takes Frotz's and Word's
#    precedent (SPEC.md 61, 68.5, and 73.12 names the disk and the machine):
#    its own floppy, all four geometries, built only when asked for.
include apps/cc/Makefile.inc

# The one thing the default build says about C, and it says it only when there
# is something to say. A guard nobody types is a guard that does not run
# (SPEC.md 15.1's shape, the same argument checkdocs is in `all` for) - but
# the converse also holds, so this is silent on a tree that has run
# setup-cc.sh, and it can never fail a build.

# --- CHELLO, the C capability gate (ON DEMAND: `make chello`) ----------------
# tests/chello is the program that established a compiled package can hold a
# window down on all three adapters: it has been booted on VGA 640x480, on CGA
# 640x200 and off a 360KB floppy, clicked, typed at, dragged and closed. It is
# under tests/ because it is a capability gate and nothing under tests/ ships
# (CLAUDE.md), so it is on demand exactly like bench.
#
# IT IS OPEN-CODED RATHER THAN CALLED THROUGH CC_PACKAGE, and the choice is
# worth writing down because the template is right there. CC_PACKAGE is
# `$(eval $(call CC_PACKAGE,<name>,<dir under apps/>))` and it roots BOTH the
# source and the shim at apps/$(2)/ - chello is under tests/, and its nasm
# line needs a third -I as well. The two ways out are a second template in
# apps/cc/Makefile.inc taking a directory, or one open-coded rule here. This
# is the second, for two reasons: there is exactly one C package outside
# apps/ and there is meant to be exactly one, so a generalised template would
# be a parameter with a single caller; and it would put knowledge of tests/
# into the SDK's own build fragment, which is the file a C author reads to
# learn how to ship an application. If a second tests/ C package ever turns
# up, that is the moment to lift these four rules into a directory-taking
# CC_PACKAGE_AT and give both callers the same one.

# all four geometries, and `make 386-c-word` boots a period machine with it.
#
# IT IS NOT THE WORD PORT (SPEC.md 73.12). §68's apps/word/ is hand-written
# assembly and the two share no file, no package name, no make target, no disk
# image, no VM directory and no extension. Nothing here may reach a `word`

# cword.c #includes the RTF tables and the RTF engine, and the shim %includes
# the one hand-written routine (SPEC.md 73.11's exception, cw_memmove - the
# only place ES is loaded). CC_PACKAGE names apps/cword/cword.c and
# apps/cword/cword.asm, which is right for the general case and four files
# short here, and make cannot see through a #include. Without these two lines
# an edit to the RTF engine or to the byte mover leaves build/cword.o88

# 5.25" HD (SPEC.md 19) for the AT-class machine. The fourth used to be the
# shipped system and apps pair's alone, on the argument that such a machine
# reads the 360KB disk in the same drive - true, and it costs the user the
# 1.2MB disk's other 831KB and makes them write DD media in an HD drive,
# which is this project's one combination known to be marginal (the note at
# $(IMG120)). So every on-demand application floppy is built in it too.
# The C toolchain has been booted from a 360KB floppy once, on chello, and
# that is the geometry a 20KB image most wants re-checked on.
#
# --verify is a standalone structural fsck of what came out (tools/os88disk.py)

# the emulator, ten minutes later, reading like a bug in the file system.
# WELCOME.RTF rides the ROOT of all three, beside CWORD.O88 - which is where
# the assembly port puts WELCOME.DOC and for a reason that is not tidiness:
# a double-click on the document launches the program through SPEC.md 54.4.2,
# and assoc_back then leaves the app's current directory on the DOCUMENT's
# (SPEC.md 54.9, 19.2.1). CWORD.OVL is resolved in that directory (SPEC.md

# that is a data store rather than a place to browse. Each image is
# --verify'd, and the verify is what catches a --select that overshot - but
# --select is told what it is choosing beside: --reserve names the root files
# (the package, an .OVL if one comes, the CCP, the texts) and prices them
# in the geometry's own clusters, so the A/0
# selection re-shapes itself as the package grows instead of the 360KB
# build stopping at 'data over capacity'. The selection is a shell
# substitution INSIDE the recipe, so a --select that fails (no A0.list, a
# bad geometry) would otherwise print nothing and the image would build with
# an empty A/0 and verify clean - which reads exactly like a working disk.
# RUNCPMIMG therefore keeps its stderr and stops the recipe when the

#
# IT IS NOT LOOM. WEAVE-SPEC 1.2's in-OS IDE is a separate package with a
# separate name, target and disk; nothing here may reach a `loom` name and
# nothing there may reach a `weave` one - the same fence §73.12 draws between
# apps/word and apps/cword.
#
# NOT IN `all`, for cworddisk's reason: a C package needs SmallerC, which
# tools/setup-cc.sh fetches and which is deliberately not in this tree
# (SPEC.md 73.1). A clone with nasm and python3 builds every SHIPPED floppy.
# The demo bundles ARE in `all` - `$(WEAVEWABS)`, packed host-side by
# tools/weavesim.py - and they are a different artifact from this disk.

# symbol, so a C package is ONE compilation and one assembly (SPEC.md 73.1):

# the icon and the association block. CC_PACKAGE names only apps/weave/weave.c
# and apps/weave/weave.asm, and make cannot see through a #include or a
# %include - so without these two lines an edit to a part leaves
# build/weave.o88 untouched, and a stale package reads exactly like the change
# having done nothing. That is the failure the word.o88 rule already paid for
# once.
#
# WILDCARDS RATHER THAN A NAMED LIST, which is where this differs from
# CWORDSRC above, and the reason is the direction each one fails in: a named
# list that falls behind the directory yields a STALE PACKAGE, silently; a
# wildcard that picks up a file the translation unit does not include yields
# one unnecessary rebuild, loudly and cheaply. Weave's source set is scheduled

# ALL FOUR geometries an APPLICATION's own floppy is built in (CLAUDE.md):
# 1.44MB and 720KB for QEMU, 360KB for an 86Box XT or a real one, and 1.2MB
# 5.25" HD (SPEC.md 19) for the AT-class machine. The fourth used to be the
# shipped system and apps pair's alone, on the argument that such a machine
# reads the 360KB disk in the same drive - true, and it costs the user the
# 1.2MB disk's other 831KB and makes them write DD media in an HD drive,
# which is this project's one combination known to be marginal (the note at
# $(IMG120)). So every on-demand application floppy is built in it too.
# --verify is a standalone structural fsck of what came out and it is in the
# recipe rather than in a target of its own because it costs milliseconds and
# catches the class of defect - a bad FAT chain, a directory entry pointing at
# nothing - that otherwise arrives as "Disk error" inside the emulator ten
# minutes later, reading like a bug in the file system.
#
# THE PACKAGE, ITS TWO MODULES AND THE BUNDLES SHARE ONE FOLDER, WEAVE/, and
# that is a correctness requirement rather than tidiness. A double-click on a
# bundle launches WEAVE through SPEC.md 54.4.2, and assoc_back then leaves the
# launched instance's current directory on the DOCUMENT's (SPEC.md 54.9,
# 19.2.1); WEAVE.OVL is resolved in that directory (SPEC.md 73.14). So a
# bundle in a folder WITHOUT the runtime opens a program whose every overlay
# path then refuses, politely and inexplicably - which is why WELCOME.RTF
# rides beside CWORD.OVL two hundred lines up. The layout itself - what the
# two folders are and why LOOM/ carries a second copy of the runtime - is the
# block below WEAVEDISK, and WEAVE-SPEC 11.2 is its record.

# --- THE BOOT-SECTOR GATE (WEAVE-SPEC 12.3, 12.1.1) --------------------------
# The SHIPPING apps/weave/wvm.inc, %included by a boot sector and run in raw
# QEMU with SS != DS and no OS under it, diffed case by case against
# tools/weavesim.py's end states. rcz80test's and c64memtest's shape, and
# WEAVE-SPEC 13.1 gates wave 3 on it FIRST: the interaction is wired to the VM
# only after the VM has been diffed against the model.
#
# It is NOT in `all` and is a prerequisite of nothing, the way `make
# rcz80test` and `make c64cputest` are not - but unlike those three it is also
# a registered soak ROW (tests/weavevm.py), because 12.3 names it as one and
# because `os88test.py soak -k 'weave*'` is this family's one command. Needs
# only nasm, python3 and qemu: the corpus is GENERATED here and never
# committed, so a change to the model moves the expected states with it.
#
# MEASURED: 1 s of guest, ~2 s wall clock including the corpus and the nasm
# run, on an idle 2024 laptop with nothing else on it.

# wave 5's FIRST gate. The difference from the row above is where the oracle
# came from: weavevm diffs two interpreters that both had end states already,
# and 6.10.2's composition had none - the model does not draw pixels and the
# canvas buffer is on no card, so the model grew a composer and this is the
# machine's half of it. The corpus is a table in weavesim rather than a
# directory, and 12.1.3 says why.

# --- WHAT WAVE 7 ADDED TO THIS DISK (WEAVE-SPEC 13.1's distribution row) -----
#
# THE IDE RIDES IT, and the arithmetic is why rather than a preference: LOOM is
# 54,966 + LOOM.OVL 42,902 + LOOM.WPV 16,216 = ~114KB, the runtime's three
# files are ~78KB, the bundles and the sources ~6KB, and the smallest geometry
# holds 354 clusters of 1KB. So all three geometries carry the family whole -
# edit, pack, preview and run on one floppy - and the recipe's own --verify
# prints the cluster count that says so.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TWO FOLDERS - WEAVE/ IS THE COMPILED PROGRAMS, LOOM/ IS THE SOURCE - AND
# WHAT THE OVERLAY FENCE MAKES EACH OF THEM CARRY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   WEAVE/   WEAVE.O88, WEAVE.OVL, WEAVE.WSM, FORM/SHEET/PONG.WAB, BUNDLES=
#   LOOM/    LOOM.O88, LOOM.OVL, LOOM.WPV, the demo SOURCES - and a SECOND
#            COPY of WEAVE.O88, WEAVE.OVL and WEAVE.WSM
#   (root)   CATALOG.TXT, SYSTEM/APPDATA
#
# The rule that shapes it: a double-click on a document leaves the launched
# instance standing in the DOCUMENT's directory (SPEC.md 54.9, 19.2.1), and a
# package's overlay and sidecars are resolved in THAT directory (SPEC.md
# 73.14). File > Open Project... is no different - the standard file dialog
# walks the volume by moving the instance's own current directory. So every
# document has to sit beside the whole of the program that opens it: a .WAB
# beside WEAVE's three files, a .WML beside LOOM's three. Wave 7 built a
# PROJECTS/ folder per project first, photographed both routes refusing
# (`LOOM.OVL is missing; a project cannot be opened.`), and shipped the whole
# disk FLAT in the root. This layout is the same fence honoured with the two
# kinds of file apart: the runtime with what it runs, the IDE with what it
# edits.
#
# WHY LOOM/ CARRIES THE RUNTIME TOO, ~77KB a disk. Pack writes the bundle
# BESIDE its sources (WEAVE-SPEC 11.4), so the first run of a bundle built on
# the machine is a double-click on LOOM/<X>.WAB - and WEAVE-SPEC 1.7's whole
# loop (Pack, click the WEAVE window, ^R Reload) reloads THAT file. Without
# WEAVE's three files in LOOM/ that double-click refuses with `WEAVE.OVL is
# missing or stale` (WEAVE-SPEC 10.3), and the disk has an IDE that can build
# a program it cannot run. A second copy and never a move, which is SPEC.md
# 24.3's own rule for the core packages on the system disk. The 360KB disk
# still holds it: ~209 clusters before, ~288 of 354 after, and the recipe's
# --verify prints the number.
#
# LOOM/ SHIPS WITH SPARE DIRECTORY SLOTS (--dir-slots), because the kernel
# does not grow a directory (SPEC.md 18.5) and Pack SAVES into this folder:
# three demo bundles' worth on a fresh disk, and the user's own after. On a
# 1.44MB disk a cluster is one sector - sixteen entries - and the folder
# ships with fourteen, so without the knob the second Pack would refuse
# with a full directory.
#
# A folder PER PROJECT remains what WEAVE-SPEC 11.2 describes for a project a
# person KEEPS beside a LOOM launched from its own directory; it is not a
# shape a distribution disk can build, for the reason above.
#
# SYSTEM/APPDATA is the one folder that is safe, because nothing resolves an
# overlay in it: it is written to, never launched from (SPEC.md 19.9).

# choose for you). They must already be valid 8.3 names; os88disk.py has no
# long-name handling and fails hard rather than truncating. The geometry still
# has to hold them, and THAT REFUSAL IS THE ROW'S OWN GATE: os88disk.py prices

# The two WEAVE machines (WEAVE-SPEC §13.1), with the Weave disk in B: instead
# of the apps disk - Frotz's precedent and Word's, for their reason: an app
# whose documents live on its own disk is best launched from that disk, and a
# .WAB IS the document here (WEAVE-SPEC §1.5 launches the runtime by
# double-clicking one).
#
#   xt-weave   An IBM XT at 4.77MHz with the FULL 640KB, booting the 360KB
#              system floppy with build/weave360.img in B: - TWO 5.25" drives,
#              no fdd_02_type override, which is where this differs from
#              xt-word: the Word disk did not fit 360KB and this one uses 33
#              of 354 clusters. So this is the only target that boots
#              build/weave360.img - QEMU is driven with the 720KB and 1.44MB
#              images (CLAUDE.md's three geometries) - and the 360KB FAT is
#              the one a real XT reads.
#
#              640KB rather than 256KB is deliberate and is argued at
#              $(VMXTWEAVE)'s definition above.
#
#   386-weave  The comfortable target the same code also has to be right on:
#              a 386DX/25 with TWO 1.44MB drives, B: = build/weave.img.
#              AT-class, so the first launch stops at the BIOS setup wanting
#              a CMOS - pick EXIT FOR BOOT once and 86Box writes
#              vm/386-weave/nvr/ for every later boot.
#
# Each config is a copy of the corresponding Word machine - one that has been
# BOOTED - with fdd_02_fn and the uuid changed and nothing else, the rule
# vm/386-c-word records: 86Box does not reject an unrecognised key, it
# substitutes a default and rewrites the config on exit, so a hand-written
# profile is a machine whose clock nobody chose.
#
# Both call $(UNPROTECT) for the standing reason: 86Box re-adds wp:// to its
# floppy paths on exit, which turns every guest write into FERR_WPROT - and
# from wave 3 that is every saveState (WEAVE-SPEC §8.3), reading as a Weave bug
# rather than an emulator setting.
#
# ON DEMAND, like every C target: `all` does not build build/weave.o88, so

# --- LOOM, the in-OS IDE (WEAVE-SPEC 1.2, wave 6) ----------------------------
# The C toolchain's fifth application, and the family's other half: the editor,
# the project's file switcher, the compilers and the bundle writer that make
# `File > Pack Bundle` produce a `.WAB` BYTE-IDENTICAL to the host packer's
# (WEAVE-SPEC 11.1). `make loom` builds the package, `make loomdisk` the floppy
# in all three geometries.
#
# IT IS NOT WEAVE. WEAVE-SPEC 1.2's runtime is a separate package with a
# separate name, target and disk; nothing here may reach a `weave` PACKAGE name
# and nothing there may reach a `loom` one - the same fence SPEC.md 73.12 draws
# between apps/word and apps/cword. What the two SHARE they share as SOURCE
# (SPEC.md 20.5.1): apps/weave/wblob.inc and apps/weave/weave.h are %included
# and #included by both images, which is why $(WEAVEINC) is a prerequisite of
# build/loom.bin below.
#
# NOT IN `all`, for cworddisk's and weavedisk's reason: a C package needs
# SmallerC, which tools/setup-cc.sh fetches and which is deliberately not in
# this tree (SPEC.md 73.1). A clone with nasm and python3 builds every SHIPPED
# floppy.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPEN-CODED RATHER THAN CALLED THROUGH CC_PACKAGE, and the reason is ONE -I.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# apps/loom/lmerr.c carries `#include "lmfoldc.h"` - WEAVE-SPEC 3.1's Latin-1
# fold table, GENERATED by tools/weavesim.py so that the model and the machine
# cannot fold a byte differently (which would be a bundle that differs by one
# character and fails 11.1's byte compare for a reason no diff would explain).
# The generated header lands in build/, and CC_PACKAGE's compile line carries
# -SI/-I for SmallerC's own include tree and -I apps/cc and nothing else.
#
# The two ways out are a fourth -I inside apps/cc/Makefile.inc - which is the
# file a C author reads to learn how to ship an application, and putting a
# build-tree path in it for one package's sake is teaching the wrong thing -
# or the four rules written here. This is the second, which is exactly the
# choice `chello` and `covl` made above and for the same shape of reason.

# first, its byte counts are written into build/wpvsize.inc, and the package is
# assembled after and compares what it read off the disk against those numbers.
#
# IT IS NOT AN OVERLAY and does not go through tools/os88ovl.py, and the reason
# is the one WEAVE-SPEC 1.7.1 has the arithmetic for: an overlay moves CODE and
# leaves every global, literal and bss byte resident (SPEC.md 73.14), while
# what does not fit here is ~4.7KB of DATA - the walk's layout table and the
# painter's six tables keyed by comp_id - against the headroom wave 6 closed
# with. An overlay cannot move one byte of that.
#
# IT IS THE FIRST C SECOND SEGMENT IN THIS TREE, which is why the compile line
# is open-coded here rather than reached through apps/cc/Makefile.inc's
# CC_PACKAGE: that macro builds a PACKAGE - a 32-byte OS88 header, an entry the
# loader calls, callback trampolines - and a module has none of those. What it
# DOES share with a package is everything that matters: the same smlrcc, the
# same tools/cc8086.py gate (SS != DS, no &local, no movs/stos, 96-byte
# frames), and apps/cc/os88thunk.asm.

# --- the LOOM floppy ---------------------------------------------------------
# ALL FOUR geometries an APPLICATION's own floppy is built in (CLAUDE.md):
# 1.44MB and 720KB for QEMU, 360KB for an 86Box XT or a real one, and 1.2MB
# 5.25" HD (SPEC.md 19) for the AT-class machine. The fourth used to be the
# shipped system and apps pair's alone, on the argument that such a machine
# reads the 360KB disk in the same drive - true, and it costs the user the
# 1.2MB disk's other 831KB and makes them write DD media in an HD drive,
# which is this project's one combination known to be marginal (the note at
# $(IMG120)). So every on-demand application floppy is built in it too.
# --verify is a standalone structural fsck of what came out.
#
# WHAT IS ON IT, AND WHY EACH FILE IS THERE:
#
#   LOOM.O88 + LOOM.OVL   the IDE, its compilers and - wave 7 - the preview
#   + LOOM.WPV            module (WEAVE-SPEC 1.2.4), a second RESIDENT segment
#                         holding WEAVE's flow walk and WEAVE's component
#                         painter, so that Preview draws the card with the
#                         same code the runtime draws it with. All three in
#                         one folder for the reason below
#   WEAVE.O88 + WEAVE.OVL the runtime, so WEAVE-SPEC 1.7's edit-run loop is
#   + WEAVE.WSM           available on the SAME disk: Pack in LOOM, click the
#                         WEAVE window, ^R. A disk with only the IDE on it can
#                         compile a bundle and not run it, which is half a loop
#   FORM/SHEET/PONG.WAB   the host-packed demo bundles - the byte-identity
#                         REFERENCE (11.1) is on the disk beside the thing that
#                         has to reproduce it
#   the demo SOURCES      FORM.WML, FORM.WJS, SHEET.WML/WJS/WFX, PONG.WML/WJS/
#                         WSP - uppercased to 8.3 by tools/os88disk.py, which
#                         upper-cases every basename it writes. THE PACK GATE
#                         HAS TO HAVE A PROJECT ON THE MACHINE TO OPEN: without
#                         these there is nothing to type at, nothing to pack
#                         and nothing to compare. They are also WEAVE-SPEC
#                         11.2's naming worked out loud - the companions are
#                         found by the .WML's own stem first (FORM.WJS beside
#                         FORM.WML), which is the spelling this disk uses.
#
# TWO FOLDERS, THE SAME TWO AS THE WEAVE DISK'S (the block above WEAVEDISK is
# the argument): LOOM/ is the IDE, the sources and a copy of the runtime,
# WEAVE/ the runtime and the bundles packed here. The fence is a correctness
# requirement rather than tidiness: a double-click on a source launches LOOM
# through SPEC.md 54.4.2 and assoc_back leaves the instance standing in the
# DOCUMENT's directory (SPEC.md 54.9, 19.2.1), and LOOM.OVL is resolved in
# that directory (SPEC.md 73.14). A project in a folder without LOOM's three
# files opens a program whose every Pack then refuses, politely and
# inexplicably. WEAVE's own disk block says the same thing about WELCOME.RTF
# and CWORD.OVL.
#
# THE 360KB DISK CARRIES THE LOT AND IT FITS - the recipe's --verify prints the
# cluster count, and if a later wave grows LOOM past it the answer is to drop
# the SOURCES from that geometry alone (they are 3KB of the total) and say so
# here, never to drop the WEAVE half: a 360KB disk that cannot run what it
# just packed is the geometry the edit-run loop matters most on, because that
# is the real XT.

# FROTZ and its story floppy (SPEC.md 61) - ON DEMAND: `make zdisk`
# =============================================================================
# Frotz does NOT ride the shipped apps disks. The 360KB one has about 100KB
# free (tools/os88disk.py --verify says so) and the interpreter alone is most
# of that, never mind a story; and a Z-machine with no story to play is a menu
# item that disappoints. So it gets its own floppy, in all three geometries,
# and `all` does not build any of them - the documented on-demand shape that
# bench, trklog and npbench already use.
#
# NO STORY FILE IS COMMITTED TO THIS REPOSITORY. Every one of them is someone
# else's work under someone else's copyright, so tools/getstories.py fetches
# them into build/stories/ against a manifest of pinned SHA-256s and the disk
# is built from there - the same decision build/big.dat made, for a stronger
# reason. The manifest is limited to what the authors released freely, which
# is why the Infocom titles are Mini-Zork I, both Samplers and Zork: The
# Undiscovered Underground rather than Zork I-III and Planetfall.
#
# Adding your own: STORIES='path/to/ZORK1.DAT path/to/HHGG.DAT' puts them in
# the disk's root beside the folders. They must already be valid 8.3 names -
# os88disk.py has no long-name handling and fails hard rather than truncating.

# takes 51 clusters on the first two and 102 on the third. The whole library
# is 2,713KB and no floppy holds it, so each geometry ships a subset and
# os88disk.py refuses at build time if a list stops fitting - which is the

#           the v5 re-release of an ADVENT.Z3 that stays, and 905.Z5, the

# --- SCRIBE: the fork of WORD (SPEC.md 95) -----------------------------------
# A SEPARATE PACKAGE and not a second build of the same source. apps/scribe/
# began as a copy of apps/word/ that kept every wd_ symbol and every wd*.inc
# filename, so `diff -r apps/word apps/scribe` was exactly what the fork
# changed; it CARRIES THE sc_ PREFIX AND THE sc*.inc FILENAMES now, and
# SPEC.md 95.1 records both sides of that trade. NASM finds the sc*.inc out of
# apps/scribe/ because that is this rule's own -I, which is also why the two
# cannot accidentally share a header.
#
# THE PACKAGE is in `all` and the FLOPPY is on demand. scribe.o88 is named in
# `all` for wire.o88's and recorder.o88's reason - it ships on no disk, and
# building it is the only thing that keeps it assembling. It is on no shipped
# disk because WORD is the one that ships and putting both on the apps floppy
# would spend 49KB to show two word processors; `make scribedisk` builds its
# floppy, in all four geometries, which is cword's arrangement (SPEC.md 73.12)
# and for cword's reason.

# --- the Frotz gate (ON DEMAND: `make ztest`) --------------------------------

# name got <n> want <n>" per check, so the transcript is a RESULT rather than
# prose to eyeball, and the two interpreters are comparable by diff.
#
# The GOLD side is generated, never hand-written: dfrotz (Frotz 2.55) runs the
# same story and its transcript is what os8088's has to match. A check that
# fails on dfrotz is a bug in the .inf, which is exactly how three of them were
# found - Inform folds constant comparisons UNSIGNED, so `(-4 < 3)` compiled to

# --- the Note Pad walk bench (ON DEMAND: `make npbench`) ---------------------
# NPBENCH.O88 is apps/notepad built with -DNPBENCH, which is the only
# difference: the shipped NOTEPAD.O88 has no bench, no Ctrl-B and no buffer,
# and the hooks that reach tests/npbench.inc are inside %ifdef NPBENCH. One
# source, two binaries - the trklog arrangement above, for its reason.
#
#   make npbench                        # build the disks (BOOTABLE, one each)
#   make test HDD= FLOPPY=build/npbench.img   # ...or boot the 1.44MB one here
#
# It builds FOUR disks: this pair around README.TXT, and the nprun pair around
# a note that is one long run with no newlines in it (SPEC.md 27.4.2), which
# README.TXT cannot show - see the second block below.
#
# WHAT IT ANSWERS: SPEC.md 27.7.3's NP_HCHUNK sizes a gfx-lock hold and had
# never been measured on iron - every figure behind it was a MartyPC cycle
# count, which is the right units and the wrong machine. Boot the disk,
# double-click README.TXT in the root, press Ctrl-B, and the report REPLACES
# the note. The disk must NOT be write-protected if you then want Ctrl-S to
# keep it.
#
# The note the numbers are quoted against is README.TXT, which every system
# disk already carries - so the reference is the shipped file rather than a
# copy here that can drift from it.

# --- ...and the ONE LONG RUN disk, for SPEC.md 27.4.2 ------------------------
#
# README.TXT is prose and CANNOT show the bug docs/plans/completed/NOTEPAD-NOTES.md 5.6 is
# about: its longest unbroken run is 28 characters, and np_cellrun needs
# np_rcols + 2 - 31 at the default 29 columns - before it will accept. So the
# reference note is the wrong instrument here, and the report sat unmeasured
# for a round because reproducing it meant hand-building a disk.
#
# RUN.TXT is that note: 709 bytes with NO NEWLINES IN IT AT ALL, one run of
# 249 characters, a semicolon, a sentence of prose, then a long tail. All
# three of the interesting carets are on it - inside the first run, just after
# the semicolon (the field's own repro), and at the end of the tail.
#
#   make npbench
#   python3 tools/notepad/lab.py --len 709 boot --image build/nprun360.img
#   ...then Down x8, Right x18, and hold a key
#
# IT CARRIES NO README.TXT, AND THAT IS THE POINT. drive.open_readme clicks a
# FIXED ROW and the root listing is sorted by name (SPEC.md 19.4), so leaving
# the reference note off puts RUN.TXT at the same ordinal README.TXT occupies
# on the disk above - APPS, MEDIA, RUN.TXT, SYSTEM - and one set of
# coordinates drives both disks. Add README.TXT here and RUN.TXT moves down a
# row, which reads as the harness failing to open anything.
#
# The note is GENERATED rather than committed, because it is 709 bytes of 'a'
# and the toolchain is deterministic on purpose: the same command makes the

# --- the A/V SYNC disk (ON DEMAND: `make clicktest`) -------------------------
#
# "The music is not synced to the display" cannot be judged against real
# music - notes are everywhere, so there is nothing to time the display
# against. CLICK.MOD (tests/mkclick.py) plays ONE click, on ONE channel, every
# TWO SECONDS, on rows 00/10/20/30 of a single looping pattern, so the whole
# question becomes one observation with no instruments at all:
#
#     when you HEAR the click, what row does the screen SHOW?
#
# Expected: 00, 10, 20 or 30. Anything else is the offset, read off the screen
# in rows, and a row is exactly 125 ms here (BPM 120, speed 6 - chosen so that
# 16 rows is 2.000 s and the arithmetic needs no calculator).
#
# It carries the TRKLOG build rather than the shipped one, because the two
# extra keys are exactly what a sync question wants: M stamps "I heard it
# here" into the current tick and W writes the log out (SPEC.md 45.14). The

# --- the benchmark disk, from tests/ (ON DEMAND: `make bench`) ---------------
#
# These are the only packages in the tree built from OUTSIDE apps/, and the
# folder is the point: tests/ holds testing apps and `all` never builds them,
# which keeps a normal build - and every shipped image - free of them. (Their
# artifacts are untracked, but so is everything else in build/ now; that used
# to be the load-bearing half of this comment.)
# The DEVELOPMENT of these apps happens on the `testing` branch; what lands
# here is a finished harness, so experimental never carries the midway
# artifacts of writing one.
#
# FONTBENCH prices the PRIMITIVE (SPEC.md 6.1.1): the same ten-character run
# drawn four ways - the hand-written gfx_fill + font_str pair and one
# font_run, each at a byte-aligned x and again at x+5.
#
# TYPEBENCH prices the KEYSTROKE (SPEC.md 11.94): 40 random characters typed
# into a 40-cell line with the whole line redrawn after each one, which is
# what np_redraw does to its dirty band. It is snappable itself and says in
# its header whether the snap took.
#
# GFXBENCH prices the WHOLE DRAWING SURFACE on whichever adapter it boots on
# (SPEC.md 39): every gfx_* and font_* slot, most of them at two sizes so the
# per-call and per-pixel terms come apart, plus the raw RAM and framebuffer
# bandwidth underneath them. One package for Hercules AND CGA on purpose -
# both are the same 1bpp renderer over four different numbers, and two sources
# would be two chances to drift.
#
# SYSBENCH prices the MACHINE: 8086-nominal clocks against a real 8088 per
# instruction class, RAM bandwidth, the clock ladder, what the kernel's own
# interrupts cost per second of work, the API's far-call floor, and the
# floppy. BENCH.DAT and BENCHSML.DAT on the disk are what its file rows read;
# they are generated here rather than tracked, like tests/filetest's big.dat.
#
# Both of the last two write their report to a TEXT FILE on the current volume
# (SPEC.md 18.4), because 90 rows do not fit a 640x200 screen and the results
# are meant to be carried off the machine and pasted into PERFORMANCE.md. That
# means the bench floppy must NOT be write-protected when you use them.
#
# ALL FOUR ride one disk, built in both geometries, because they answer the
# same question at different scales and you want them side by side:
#
#   make bench                                             # build the disks
#   make test                            TESTAPPS=build/bench.img   # 1.44M, QEMU
#   make test VIDEO=cga                  TESTAPPS=build/bench.img
#   make test VIDEO=herc HERCSEG=0x7000  TESTAPPS=build/bench.img
#
# `make test TESTAPPS=build/bench.img` builds the disk on demand by itself -
# TESTAPPS is a prerequisite of the test targets - so `make bench` is for
# building it without booting (e.g. to write build/bench360.img to a floppy).
#
# build/bench360.img is the same disk at 9 spt / 40 cylinders - what an XT
# BIOS can actually read, so it is the one to write to a real 5.25" floppy or
# hand to 86Box. THAT is where these numbers are worth taking: on a 4.77MHz
# 8088 the PIT is a wall clock and the microsecond column means microseconds.
#
# Under QEMU it does not. QEMU runs the guest at host speed, so add
# `-icount shift=3,sleep=off` and the PIT counts guest INSTRUCTIONS instead -
# reproducible and machine-independent, but not time, and it understates the
# mono win because what alignment removes is disproportionately memory
# traffic (SPEC.md 6.1.1).

# BROWSER.HTM is the page that SHIPS (SPEC.md 71.12) and DEMO.HTM the one
# that no longer does. Both are here, and having both is the point: four rows
# below open DEMO.HTM by name and it stays their fixture, while the shipped
# manual gets a disk it can be rendered from at all - which nothing could do
# while the shipped page and the fixture were one file.
#
# IT IS THE ONLY ONE PASSED STRAIGHT FROM ITS SOURCE, and that is not a
# shortcut. The copies below exist to RENAME - `frogfind-de-ie5.htm` is not an
# 8.3 name and `demo.htm` is not on the disk it ships from - and os88disk.py
# upper-cases what it is given, so `apps/browser/browser.htm` already lands as
# `BROWSER.HTM` with no copy at all. Making one anyway puts a SECOND
# `build/BROWSER.HTM` beside the shipped file's own name, and that is what
# tests/unit/t_pkg.py resolves an image's files against: `make browsertest` is
# not part of `all`, so the copy goes stale the moment the page is edited and
# every shipped apps image then fails a freshness check about a disk that is
# perfectly fresh. Renaming is a reason for a copy; having one is not.

# --- the FIELD disks: one BOOTABLE 360KB floppy per adapter ------------------
#
# `make field` -> the NARROW disks, for the questions `make combo` cannot
# answer. It is no longer the default ask (that is combo.img, below), and
# herc.img/cga.img in particular are now the special case rather than the
# ordinary one: SPEC.md 39.11's Display page switches the adapter at RUN TIME,
# so a pinned-adapter build is only wanted when a run must fix the card at
# BOOT, or must compare against an older set that was taken that way. What is
# still only here: cga720 (a 720KB GEOMETRY, for the Toshiba T1100 Plus),
# flop1 (FLOPPY1=1) and cqdiag (BOOTDIAG=1).
#
# All of them are shaped by the machine this project is calibrated against
# (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md, E1: an IBM PC 5150 with ONE floppy drive - the
# second bay is an ST-225 - and both a Hercules and a CGA card in it at all
# times).
#
# THE BENCHMARKS ARE ON THE BOOT DISK. With no drive B, the two-floppy shape
# `make bench` produces would mean swapping disks mid-session on the one
# machine where a disk swap is a walk to another room. These carry the
# benchmarks in the root of the SYSTEM disk instead - the TASKMGR.O88
# precedent (SPEC.md 28.3), for exactly the same reason - so booting one puts
# them one double-click away, and the reports they save land back on the disk
# they came from. os88disk marks them visible + read-only (SPEC.md 19.6), so
# they list and cannot be deleted by accident, and the disk is NOT
# write-protected because the reports are the point.
#
# ONE IMAGE PER CARD, because the probe (SPEC.md 39.1) finds the Hercules
# first and a machine that holds both can only be asked one question at a
# time. herc.img is the ordinary SHIPPED kernel - so it exercises the probe on
# the way past - and cga.img is a VIDEO=cga kernel that ignores the Hercules.
# That kernel is built in a directory of its own: a VIDEO=-forced kernel that
# reaches build/ is a machine that boots the wrong card for everyone, and that
# is a mistake that has been made.
#
# The names are short and unambiguous at a DOS prompt on purpose: DOS 3.3 has
# 8.3 names and no tab completion, and these get typed by hand into dskimage.
# NOBIG=1 leaves BIGFILE.DAT off the field disks. It is 170KB of the 354 a
# 360KB floppy holds, so a full disk has ~14KB free and SPEC.md 18.4's write
# rows step all the way down and skip - and a WRITE bench with no room to
# write in is the one thing it cannot be. Without it there is ~185KB free and
# the row gets its full 128KB.
#
# The trade is stated rather than hidden: BIGFILE.DAT is what PERFORMANCE.md
# Part 9 Set 13's DOS cross-check reads, and what SPEC.md 18.95.4's
# cache-width sweep walks, so a NOBIG disk skips that row and says so. Build
# one of each if you want both, and they have the same NAMES - so build,
# copy, rebuild.

# EVERY field kernel is built DISKCNT=1, and there is no separate instrumented
# disk any more. Both halves of the reason there used to be one have expired:
#
#   "the counters are two instructions in the hot path of every transfer" -
#   measured, they are about twelve instructions per int 13h CALL (not per
#   sector) against a 238 ms sector, and the image is BYTE FOR BYTE the same
#   size either way because the growth lands inside the padding to OVL_START.
#
#   "the published word is an ABI that depends on a knob" - it was, when it
#   was a fixed word at 0060:000E. SPEC.md 57's registry is exactly the fix
#   for that: the block is found by TAG, and a reader that cannot find one
#   says so and continues. One build of sysbench already serves both kernels.
#
# The second is the one worth noticing: a later change removed the reason and
# nobody went back to re-ask the question. What it buys is a DISK SWAP - the
# 5150 has one drive (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md), so a second disk is a swap and
# a reboot in the middle of every batch.

# --- the SMALL build (docs/history/KERN-SPLIT-PLAN.md) -------------------------------
#
# `make small` builds kern_small and its system disks. THE DEFAULT IS BIG, so
# this is the one that is asked for - and it builds into a directory of its
# own, build/smallk/, for the reason the field kernels do: a knob-built kernel
# that reaches build/ is a kernel somebody boots by accident believing it is
# the shipped one, and that mistake has been made in this tree before (see the
# cgak note above). Nothing under build/smallk/ is what `all` ships.
#
# The APPS disks are NOT rebuilt and must not be: a package is the same bytes
# on both kernels by construction, because the two builds hold the SAME API
# table at the same offsets (docs/history/KERN-SPLIT-PLAN.md 3). The day that stops
# being true is the day the split acquired an ABI, which is the one thing this
# design is written to avoid.
SMALLDIR := $(BUILD)/smallk
SMALLAPPDIR := $(BUILD)/smallapp
                                    # ...and where the small BUILDS of the
                                    # packages go. Beside $(SMALLDIR) because
                                    # both name a directory the small product
                                    # is assembled into, and both are read by
                                    # the system disk's rule below

# ...and its drivers are $(DRIVERS) LESS THE STORE ABOVE 1MB AND LESS THE RAM
# DISK. XMEM.DRV is dead weight on this kernel and only on this one: xmem.inc
# is entirely inside %ifdef KERN_BIG and so is drv_load_at, its only loader,
# and it has no drv_tab row that a Drivers page could tick - so nothing on a
# kern_small disk can name it, read it or load it. The serial monitor was out
# of $(DRIVERS) for the same reason before it was removed outright
# (SPEC.md 58).
#
# RAMDISK.DRV and RAMPAGE.DRV go for the same reason one level up (SPEC.md
# 62.9.15): a 128-256KB machine has nothing to spare for a store made of the
# memory it is short of, so the row, the settings blob, the driver file dialog
# and the Control Panel's whole keyboard are all inside %ifdef KERN_BIG now and
# there is no row here that could name these two files. Leaving them on the
# disk would be ~11KB of a 360KB floppy carrying software this kernel cannot
# reach.
# ...AND NEITHER DOES ANY OTHER `.DRV`. SPEC.md 51.0 takes the loadable-driver
# mechanism out of kern_small altogether, so SOUND, HDD, NET, ETHER and
# HDDTOOL are not "unused" on this disk - there is no code left that could
# name, read or load them. That is 49,621 bytes of a 360KB floppy, 13.5% of
# it, and it is SPEC.md 24.5's rule applied one layer down: if it can never
# run there, it does not go on the disk.
#
# STATED AS WHAT IT IS rather than as a filter-out list, and that is the point
# of writing it this way: a driver added to $(DRIVERS) tomorrow must NOT
# appear on this disk, and a subtraction list would have put it there
# silently. $(KMODS) is the on-demand KERNEL MODULES (SPEC.md 2.8) - the
# Control Panel, Format and Clone - which are this kernel's own code cut out
# of its own binary and are a different mechanism entirely; $(SMALLMODS) adds
# kern_small's two extra. RECURSIVE, like $(DRIVERS) itself, so $(KMODS)
# inside it still reads the per-target KMODDIR.

# --- WHAT THE SMALL DISKS DO NOT CARRY (SPEC.md 24.5) -------------------------
#
# **If it can never run there, it does not go on the disk.** Every row below is
# a package whose REQUIREMENT kern_small cannot meet, and the requirement is
# what puts it here - this is not a list of the biggest packages and must not
# become one. A package that merely wants a lot of heap still ships: it will
# refuse itself on the machine, in its own words, which is a thing the user can
# read (SPEC.md 42.6 is the worked example). A package that cannot reach its
# DRIVER cannot say anything at all.
#
#   browser, ftpd, telnet,  ETHER.DRV. The NIC is not in $(SMALLDRIVERS) and
#   thewire                 SPEC.md 72's whole surface is driver verbs, so
#                           there is no socket to refuse on. The Wire is the
#                           odd one: it rides the SYSTEM disk rather than the
#                           apps disk (SPEC.md 24.3), so what drops it is
#                           $(SMALLSYSAPPS) below rather than the apps lists -
#                           and it is named HERE so that one list stays the
#                           authority for "kern_small cannot run this at all"
#   tracker,                SOUND.DRV, which a 128-256KB machine has nothing
#   audio                   to spare for - the same judgement that took
#                           RAMDISK.DRV and RAMPAGE.DRV out of $(SMALLDRIVERS)
#   skies                   a 32KB heap claim for its frame shadow, which the
#                           128KB machine's 17.5KB of largest run cannot fund -
#                           and, unlike PAINT, it cannot say so: the claim is
#                           made INSIDE the fsx bracket, after the mode is set,
#                           so the refusal is a black screen and a bounce back
#                           to the desktop. TANK was this row's other half and
#                           SHIPS NOW (SPEC.md 85.3.5.1): its template stopped
#                           being a second 16,000-byte frame buffer, the claim
#                           went 32KB to a ladder of 18/17/16, and it runs on
#                           the floor machine. `kern_small` has fsx like every
#                           other build - that was never what either of them
#                           was missing
#   sheet                   SPEC.md 24.5.2's THIRD GROUND, and it is a
#                           requirement rather than a size: what SHEET claims
#                           on open - grid, cell store, undo - is close to
#                           100KB, which is more RAM than this machine has in
#                           TOTAL before its 48,352-byte region is counted at
#                           all. PAINT wants a lot of heap and ships, because
#                           whether it runs depends on what else is open and
#                           its refusal is real information; SHEET's answer
#                           does not depend on anything, so the test is "is
#                           there a state of this machine in which this
#                           package runs" and only a no comes off the disk.
#                           **THE GROUND WAS PUBLISHED AND THE WIRING WAS
#                           NEVER DONE**: SPEC.md 24.5.2 argued this at
#                           length when it landed (PR #147) and this list
#                           never carried the name, so 36,696 bytes of
#                           spreadsheet went on shipping on both small apps
#                           floppies with every build step green
#
# RECORDER WAS THE FOURTH SOUND ROW AND IS NOT A ROW ANY MORE. It is off the
# shipped apps disk entirely (SPEC.md 35.1), so it is not in $(APPS_TOOLS) for
# this list to subtract from - and a name here that no list contains is a
# filter that reads like a decision and is a no-op, which is the shape a stale
# omit list takes. The rule it would have failed is unchanged and would still
# omit it if it came back. MODPLUG left for the same reason one cycle on: it
# is RETIRED (SPEC.md 56.15) and in no list at all.

# MIDIRACK (SPEC.md 105) is the AUDIO row's omission three times over: its FM

# be left is the one-voice tone, and a MIDI player that can only whistle the
# melody is not the program the disk would be offering. Its songs are not in
# $(APPS_DATA), so they leave the small disks with it.
# VIDEO (SPEC.md 98.3) is a REQUIREMENT omission of the SOUND rows' kind: it
# plays through FSXF_RATE (53.2.2) and OSAPI_FILE_READ_SEQ (18.4.8), and both

#

# THIS IS A PROGRAM WHOSE DOCUMENT IS NOT.** Same rule, opposite direction,

# they open a window and a File > Open dialog onto a volume with nothing on

# the kernel looking for a requirement that was never the problem, which is
# what SPEC.md 24.5's TANK row already cost this project once.

#                           cross-app spawn API in this OS - so its ONLY
#                           launch path is File > Open on a SYLK, DIF or BIFF

#                           that WRITES one is SHEET, which the row above has
#                           just taken off. The Makefile has already made
#                           exactly this call once, at $(APPS_TOOLS_360)
#                           ~1,000 lines below: "a chart viewer whose ONLY

#                           moved, too - no small floppy has ever carried a

#                           recipes and in neither small one, and ty_gofonts
#                           (SPEC.md 19.8) walks to exactly that one folder on
#                           the system volume. So the viewer lists an empty
#                           folder - SPEC.md 24.3's "working, and
#                           indistinguishable from broken", which is the
#                           argument SPEC.md 90.3 itself uses to keep the
#                           package ON the live media, where the faces ARE.
#                           It reached these two floppies through
#                           $(CORE_TOOLS) and 90.3 said so in as many words;
#                           what that sentence did not check is whether the
#                           folder it is core FOR is on the disk
#
# The alternative for FONTVIEW is to put the ten faces on instead - ~9KB
# packed plus the licence - and it was not taken: the faces are there on the
# shipped system disk BECAUSE that disk has the programs that use them, and
# spending eleven clusters of a 128KB machine's floppy on a viewer is the
# size argument SPEC.md 24.5 forbids run in reverse.
SMALLOMIT_ORPHAN := $(BUILD)/chart.o88 $(BUILD)/fontview.o88

# ...and it is applied EVERYWHERE $(SMALLOMIT) is - the apps list, the core
# list, the sysapps list and both games lists - rather than only at the two
# that carry a name today. Chart rides $(APPS_TOOLS) and Font Viewer rides
# $(CORE_TOOLS), so this list already spans two of the five; a list that is
# filtered in some of the places a package can reach a floppy from is the
# defect $(SMALLBASE) was given a walker for after Solitaire shipped twice on
# one disk. No GAME is an orphan today and the two games lines cost one token
# each to make that a fact rather than a thing to remember.

# ...and BROWSER.HTM with the browser, for the same reason one step along: a
# .HTM is openable by nothing else on the machine (SPEC.md 71), and a manual
# for a program that is not on the disk is worse than no file at all.
#
# **DERIVED FROM $(APPS_DATA), NEVER SPELLED - and DEFERRED (`=`), which is
# the whole of why this works.** It named `apps/browser/browser.htm` and
# `apps/tracker/beverly.mod` and matched NOTHING from the day it was written,
# which was the day compression shipped (PR #172), because the
# $(PKGZ) arm ~1,000 lines below REDEFINES $(APPS_DATA) from the source files
# to lz4-packed copies under $(ZDATA)/ - and PKGZ defaults to lz4, so the arm
# that ships is the one this filter could not see. Both files went out on
# both small apps floppies with every build step green. That block's own
# comment names the trap ("a list held in two arms is a list that drifts in
# the arm nobody builds by hand") about the line directly above it and this
# variable is the same defect one name along; $(MEDIA_DISK_DATA) beside it is
# redefined in both arms and this was not.
#
# A `filter` over the live list cannot drift, because there is only ever one
# list: whatever spelling $(APPS_DATA) is in when this expands is the
# spelling matched. Both cases are covered - the plain arm's lower-case
# source paths and the packed arm's upper-case 8.3 names - since a %-pattern
# match is the only thing here that is case-sensitive.

                                    # this takes it off the 1.44MB one too

# ...and a guard on the derivation, because the failure it replaces was a

# every geometry, so an empty result means the spelling moved a THIRD time
# and the two files are on their way back onto the floppies.

# --- THE SMALL SYSTEM DISK CARRIES THE WHOLE APPS PAYLOAD (SPEC.md 24.5.6) ----
#
# **A 128KB MACHINE IS THE LIKELIEST SINGLE-FLOPPY MACHINE THERE IS, AND THIS
# IS WHAT MAKES IT ONE.** It used to take $(CORE_TOOLS) alone - SPEC.md 24.3's
# core packages, a second copy on the system disk so that a one-drive machine
# had *something* to run - which on this kernel came out as Note Pad, Paint
# and Minesweeper. That is a floor and not a system: the machine booted, and
# the programs it could reach were three.
#
# It takes the SAME PAYLOAD `make smallapps` writes now, because the
# arithmetic says it can: the union is **246 of 354 clusters** at 360KB, with
# 108 spare. The two disks overlap in four packages already (Note Pad, Paint,
# the Task Manager and Minesweeper), the kernel and its five modules are 75 of
# those clusters and are on the system disk either way, and what the apps disk
# adds on top is 121.
#
# **$(SMALLCOREARGS) IS DELETED RATHER THAN LEFT UNUSED**, and so are the two
# lists behind it. The filtered core set is a SUBSET of the filtered apps set -
# Browser and Telnet are in $(SMALLOMIT), Font Viewer in $(SMALLOMIT_ORPHAN),
# and Note Pad, Paint and Minesweeper are all in $(APPS_TOOLS)/$(APPS_GAMES)
# anyway - so keeping it beside the new list would be a second filter that
# subtracts nothing, which is the shape SPEC.md 24.5 names for a stale omit
# list and refuses.
#
# THE APPS DISK IS UNCHANGED AND `make smallapps` STAYS. 108 clusters is this
# cycle's margin rather than a property of the geometry, and this project keeps
# making applications: the day the union stops fitting, the system disk goes
# back to a curated subset and the apps floppy is what still carries
# everything. That is SPEC.md 24.6.1's rule - being carried on a disk is a
# decision with a date on it - applied one disk along, and os88disk.py refusing
# an image that does not fit is the enforcement.

# **`.SECONDEXPANSION:` AND `$$` ON TWO OF THESE, BECAUSE A PREREQUISITE IS
# EXPANDED WHEN THE RULE IS READ AND NOT WHEN THE TARGET IS CONSIDERED.**
# $(APPS_TOOLS) and $(APPS_GAMES) are defined ~400 lines BELOW this point, so
# `$(SMALLTOOLS)` and `$(SMALLGAMES)` here expand to NOTHING however carefully
# they were deferred with `=`: the comment on $(SMALLGAMES) itself warns about
# exactly this ordering for the RECIPE and the prerequisite half went
# unnoticed, because `make all` builds every package into build/ anyway and
# the empty list is invisible there. In a PRIVATE tree that builds only what
# it needs (tools/os88build.py, `make BUILD=<dir> smallapps`) it is
# `os88disk: error: cannot read <dir>/artful.o88` - a rule asking for a file
# nothing was told to produce, which is the same failure mode $(APPS_TOOLS_360)
# further down calls out for the mirror-image case.
#
# A `$$`-prefixed prerequisite under `.SECONDEXPANSION:` is expanded a second
# time, when the target is considered - by which point both lists exist. It
# reaches only prerequisites that carry `$$`, so the plain ones here and
# every rule below are untouched.
#
# **IT IS DECLARED HERE, ABOVE THE SMALL SYSTEM DISK, AND NOT DOWN BESIDE
# THE APPS ONE.** `.SECONDEXPANSION:` binds the rules that come AFTER it, so
# a declaration next to `$(BUILD)/smallapps360.img` reaches that rule and not
# these two - which since SPEC.md 24.5.6 carry the same lists and need the
# same deferral. A rule whose `$$(…)` prerequisite is out of scope does not
# error: make takes `$$(SMALLTOOLS)` as a literal filename, finds no rule for
# it and says so, which at least fails loudly - but the failure names a file
# nobody wrote rather than the directive that is missing.
#
# **$(SMALLDATA)/$(SMALLDATA_360) ARE HERE FOR THE SAME REASON AND WERE MISSED
# ONCE.** They were in the RECIPE and in neither prerequisite list at all, so
# a private tree failed at `os88disk: error: cannot read
# <dir>/zdata-lz4/PAPER.TEX` - the identical sentence $(SMALLTOOLS) above was
# added for, about a different variable. Filtering a per-disk list in the
# recipe and not in the prerequisites is one defect with as many instances as
# the recipe has lists, and the only way to be done with it is to check every
# line of the recipe against this one.
.SECONDEXPANSION:

$(BUILD)/small360.img: KMODDIR := $(SMALLDIR)

# $(SMALLMODS) is the ON-DEMAND KERNEL MODULES (SPEC.md 2.8), and it is
# listed here rather than folded into $(KMODS) because these rules expand in
# the OUTER make where KERN_SMALL is not set - which is how FILECP.DRV came to
# be left off the disk with every build step green
# (docs/plans/completed/KERN-SMALL-MODULE-SPLIT.md 9.2.5).
#
# IN THE RECIPE ONLY, AND NOT IN THE PREREQUISITES. Nothing in the outer make
# can build $(SMALLDIR)/filecp.drv: it is cut out of $(SMALLDIR)/kernel.bin by
# the SUB-MAKE this recipe runs, so demanding it up front asks make for a file
# that cannot exist until the recipe has started - `No rule to make target'.
# $(SMALLDIR)/kernel.bin and $(SMALLDIR)/boot360.bin are the same shape and
# are already absent from this list for the same reason.
#
# $(SMALLDRIVERS) looks like a counter-example and is not: KMODDIR is a
# TARGET-SPECIFIC variable, which GNU make applies to the recipe and NOT to a
# prerequisite list expanded when the makefile is read - so that name is
# `build/ctrl.drv` above the tab and `build/smallk/ctrl.drv` below it, and
# only the first has a rule. It works by that asymmetry rather than in spite
# of it, which is why $(SMALLMODS) - spelled with $(SMALLDIR) directly, so the
# same both sides - could not join it.
#
# What still triggers the rebuild is $(SMALLDRIVERS)' big-build half: those
# fall out of $(BUILD)/kernel.bin, so any kernel source change makes them
# newer than the disk. And a module the sub-make somehow failed to write is
# LOUD rather than silent - os88disk.py is handed the name and refuses.
#
# ONE SUB-MAKE FOR BOTH SMALL DISKS, AND IT HAS TO BE ONE. Each image used to
# run its own `$(MAKE) BUILD=$(SMALLDIR)` in its recipe, and `make small` asks
# for both - so under -j two recursive makes ran AT ONCE in the same directory,
# each building $(SMALLDIR)'s kernel and everything under it. Neither can see
# the other's jobs, so both rebuilt $(SMALLDIR)/artful.bin for $(ASSOCICO)
# and one packed it while the other's nasm had it at 0 bytes: `os88pkg: error:
# file is 0 bytes; header alone is 32` on build/smallk/artful.o88, a failure
# that passes on the re-run and so reads as a flake. Any `make -j small` could
# hit it; tools/os88test.py builds its `wants=` serially for exactly this class
# of race, which is why the suite never saw it. `smallsub` builds both boot
# sectors in one sub-make and both images wait on it; ORDER-ONLY, so what
# triggers an image's rebuild is exactly what did before (the paragraph above)
# and the phony never makes a disk look out of date by itself.

# canvas coordinates with no pointer lock; a desktop hypervisor answers the
# same port for the same reason. On those machines the pointer tracks 1:1 with
# no grab, which is the difference between a demo somebody closes and one they
# use.
#
# **IT IS A THIRD BUILD RATHER THAN A DEFAULT BECAUSE OF WHO PAYS.** The
# protocol is 32-bit - `in eax, dx` with a dword magic - so an 8088 can neither
# speak it nor be spoken to, and the 4.77 MHz XT this project is calibrated
# against is exactly the machine that was carrying it: 385 bytes of kernel
# image and one crossed 512-byte footprint rung, for a gate byte nailed to 0.
# SPEC.md 41.12 made this argument for XMEM.DRV and stopped one step short,
# keeping a resident sniff because an 8086 CAN ask whether there is memory
# above 1MB. Here even the probe is 386 code, so there is no resident question
# an XT could ask, and the right resident cost on it is zero.
#
# INTO A DIRECTORY OF ITS OWN, build/emuk/, for `make small`'s reason: a
# non-default kernel that reaches build/ is a kernel somebody boots by accident
# believing it is the shipped one, and that mistake has been made in this tree
# before. Nothing under build/emuk/ is what `all` ships.
#
# **THE APPS DISKS ARE NOT REBUILT AND MUST NOT BE.** kern_emu defines
# KERN_BIG, so it holds the same API table at the same offsets as the shipped
# kernel - not "compatible with", THE SAME - and build/apps.img pairs with it
# unchanged. `make small` has to say this carefully because the two kernels
# there have different feature sets; here there is nothing to say beyond it.

	@echo "     boot. Pair it with the SHIPPED build/apps.img - same ABI."

# its kernel is $(EMUDIR)'s, so its on-demand kernel modules are too. kern_emu
# cuts the same six as kern_big (ctrl, format, clone, hiber, dock, extd): it is
# that kernel with one file switched on, so there is no $(SMALLMODS)
# equivalent here and $(KMODS) $(BIGMODS) - both inside $(DRIVERS) - is right.
$(BUILD)/emu.img: KMODDIR := $(EMUDIR)

# $(EMUDRIVERS)' big-build half falls out of $(BUILD)/kernel.bin, so any kernel
# source change makes it newer than this disk and the sub-make below reruns -
# $(BUILD)/small.img's note explains why the target-specific KMODDIR makes that
# name `build/ctrl.drv` in this prerequisite list and `build/emuk/ctrl.drv` in
# the recipe, and it works here by the same asymmetry.
#
# **SYSTEM.CFG IS SHIPPED ON THIS DISK AND ON NO OTHER**, and it is the reason
# the disk exists rather than a detail of it. Every drv_tab row is NOT WANTED
# by default (SPEC.md 51.3), so a floppy carrying no settings file boots with
# the backdoor untouched - correct for the shipped disks, and useless here: a
# kern_emu machine that has to be told through the Control Panel to turn on the
# one feature it was built for has not been given anything. build/vmmcfg is the
# gate's own SYSTEM.CFG with bit 5 set, which is the absolute mouse's bit and
# not its row number (drv_cfgbit), and it is reused verbatim rather than copied.

# ONE GEOMETRY, and that is a decision rather than an omission. 360KB exists
# for real period hardware - a 5.25" drive on an XT or an AT - and no machine
# that needs a 360KB floppy can execute a 386 instruction, so an emu disk in
# that geometry would be a disk that cannot boot the kernel on it. v86 takes a
# 1.44MB floppy image and every hypervisor here does too. If a 720KB emu disk
# is ever wanted, it is this rule with --size 720 and nothing else.

# --- THE SMALL APPS DISK (SPEC.md 27.16) -------------------------------------
#
# `make smallapps` is the APPS half of `make small`: the same floppy in the
# same two geometries, with the SMALL BUILD of any package that has one in
# place of the shipped one. Note Pad was the first consumer and Paint the second
# (SMALLPKGS below is the list).
#
# IT IS NOT A SECOND ABI, and that is the whole reason this is a disk rather
# than a kernel feature. A small-built package calls the same API table at the
# same offsets as every other (docs/history/KERN-SPLIT-PLAN.md 3), so it runs on
# kern_big exactly as it runs on kern_small - it simply has fewer features.
# What pairs it with kern_small is which floppy it is written to, and nothing
# else. `make small`'s note that a package is "one package, both kernels" is
# still true: this is ONE PACKAGE BUILT TWICE, not two packages.
#
# So the shipped build/apps*.img are UNTOUCHED and must stay that way - the
# default is the full package on every disk `all` produces, exactly as the
# default kernel is kern_big.
#
# THE PATTERN IS `modplugdbg`'s, deliberately: a subdirectory build plus a
# substituted package on an otherwise ordinary disk. That keeps -DAPP_SMALL
# off every shipped nasm line, which is why it is not in $(KNOBS) and needs no
# row in the build matrix - no top-level `make` can carry it into build/.

# --- ...AND THEY PACK LIKE EVERY OTHER PACKAGE (SPEC.md 20.13.5) --------------
# `$(OS88PKG)` and $(PKGZSTAMP), which is how all ~40 shipped packages are
# stamped and which these five spelled `python3 tools/os88pkg.py` instead -
# dropping $(PKGZARG) and with it the compression, on the ONE floppy built for
# the machine with the least disk. TANK's rule below already used $(OS88PKG),
# so `make smallapps` shipped one packed package and five plain ones and the
# inconsistency was invisible: a `.o88` is a valid package either way and the
# kernel reads both (20.13.3), so nothing refused and nothing looked wrong.
# The flags byte is where it shows - 0x09 on a packed package against 0x01 -
# and `tools/os88pkgsize.py`'s "on disk" line is what prints the cost.

# --- a build target per TYPEFACE (SPEC.md 6.2) -------------------------------
#
# `make font-tallx` is a pair of system disks in that face; `make fonts` is
# all of them; `make fontsheet-<name>` is the proof sheet, on VGA pixels and
# on the CGA's 2.4:1 ones. None of it is in `all` and none of it changes a
# shipped byte - THE DEFAULT IS STILL THE MACHINE'S OWN ROM FONT, because
# these rules pass FONT= to a sub-make and never to this one.
#
# The rules are GENERATED from $(FONTS), which is the fonts/ directory read at
# parse time, so adding a face is adding a file: `make fontlist` will list it,
# `make fonts` will build it, and nothing here has to be edited. That is the
# whole point - the knob could always name any face, but only one existed and
# only one thing could be built with it.
#
# Each face's kernel goes in a directory of ITS OWN, build/fontk-<name>/, for
# the reason `small` and the field kernels do (the cgak note above): a kernel
# built with a knob that reaches build/ is one somebody boots by accident
# believing it is the shipped one, and that mistake has been made here. The
# finished disks are named for the face and sit in build/ like the field
# disks, because a disk says which face it carries in its own file name.
#
# The APPS disks are NOT rebuilt and must not be, which is `small`'s argument

# --- WHY NO FIELD BENCH DISK CARRIES DOS.O88 --------------------------------
# It used to, and `make field` was BROKEN because of it. These five are
# measurement disks for docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md's machines - kernel, drivers,
# the bench packages and their data - and the calibration machine has ONE
# floppy drive, so every cluster on them is spoken for. $(SYSROOTARG) was
# added to all of them when DOS.O88 became a system-disk file, and the 360KB
# ones have not fitted since: `herc.img` wanted 376 of 354 clusters with the
# PLAIN package on it and 393 with SPEC.md 96.40.3's parted one. Nothing on
# these disks opens a .COM - there is no apps floppy to put one on and no
# second drive to hold it - so the fix is to take it off rather than to find
# room for it: 348 of 354, with six to spare.
#
# THE OVERFLOW WAS HIDDEN BY A SECOND DEFECT until the parted package made it
# worse, and the pair is the thing to remember: `$(BUILD)/herc.img: KMODDIR :=
# $(HERCDIR) $(SYSROOT)` set the variable to TWO paths, so $(KMODS) named
# `build/herck build/dos.o88/ctrl.drv` and os88disk stopped at `cannot read
# build/herck: Is a directory` BEFORE it ever counted a cluster. One broken
# target reporting the other one's error is why neither was fixed.

# its kernel is $(HERCDIR)'s, so its modules are too
# **$(SYSROOT) BELONGED ON THE PREREQUISITE LINE AND NOT THIS ONE.** It was
# appended here as well, which set KMODDIR to TWO paths for this target - so
# $(KMODS) expanded to `build/herck build/dos.o88/ctrl.drv`, a directory that
# has never existed, and the disk asked os88disk for it. Every other

#                       through int 21h rather than the BIOS
#   build/comscan.img   a BOOTABLE floppy carrying the same code as its
#                       "kernel" - the shipped boot sector loads anything at
#                       KERNEL_SEG:0 that honours its three-point handoff, so

#                       rides along on the same disk for the DOS route

# There WAS a third image here - the same package on a FAT16 volume, built on
# the 2.88MB test geometry, which exercised the one part of the write path
# FAT12 cannot. It went with DSK_FAT_SECS: at 10 sectors the mount's rule 10
# rejects every FAT16 volume there can be (a FAT is only FAT16 with >= 4,085
# clusters, i.e. >= 16 FAT sectors), so the image would build and refuse to
# mount. dsk_next_clus / dskw_setfat keep their FAT16 halves, unreachable.

# The software floppies (drive B:) hold packages, not boot code - os88fs only.
# The volume is FOLDERED (SPEC.md 19.2): the root holds APPS and GAMES, so a
# package is two double-clicks away rather than one. The one root-level file
# is TASKMGR.O88, which is there for the chip menu on a single-floppy machine
# (SPEC.md 28.1) and not to be double-clicked.
#
# The order of these lists DOES NOT MATTER and nothing may be built on it.
# It used to: the listing was directory order, so the order a package was
# named here was the row it appeared on, new packages had to append at the
# end of their folder, and the scripted tests clicked by that index. The
# mount sorts by name now (SPEC.md 19.4), so a volume lists alphabetically
# whoever wrote it and whatever order its entries are stored in - which is
# also the only answer that survives a host OS writing to the disk. What is
# left here is which packages ship and which folder each lands in.
#
# RECORDER.O88 IS NOT HERE and that is deliberate (SPEC.md 35.1): the sound
# layer's recording client no longer ships on any floppy. It is still built -
# `all` names it for WIREFRAME's reason, one screen down from $(BUILD)/wire.o88
# - so it keeps assembling and SPEC.md 35 keeps describing something that
# compiles; what changed is which disks carry it, which is nothing.
#
# FONTVIEW.O88 AND HELLO.O88 ARE BOTH OFF THIS LIST, by the owner's decision,
# and they come off it for different reasons and land in different places.
#
# FONTVIEW is a MOVE and not a removal (SPEC.md 90.3): it stays in $(CORE_TOOLS)
# above, so it is in APPS/ on all four SYSTEM disks and it is the one core
# package that is not also on the apps disk. The copy that came off was never
# reaching anything this one does not - ty_gofonts goes to OSAPI_VOL_SYS
# (SPEC.md 19.8), the SYSTEM volume, so both copies listed the same ten faces
# off A:, and the system disk's own warm ASSOC.DAT is what a double-clicked
# .F88 in SYSTEM/FONTS/ resolves through. $(CORE_SYSONLY) below is what tells
# the guard to expect it; the 360KB paragraph further down is the arithmetic
# this used to be decided by, kept because the reasons in it are still reasons.
#
# HELLO comes off every floppy there is (SPEC.md 27.0). It is the SDK's worked
# example rather than an application - no icon, no association, no document,
# one window saying "Hello from a .o88 package!" - and `all` names
# $(BUILD)/hello.o88 directly so that it keeps assembling, which is
# RECORDER.O88's arrangement one paragraph up and WIREFRAME's before that. It
# is not in $(SMALLOMIT) or $(COMBO_DROP) for the reason RECORDER is not: a
# filter naming something no list contains reads like a decision and is a

# The CORE PACKAGES (SPEC.md 24.3) are a SECOND copy on the system disk and

# above is what a person does when they see the same package named twice in one file,
# and the result - a core package that ships on the system disk ALONE - is a
# working build whose apps disk has quietly lost a program.
#
# So it is checked, and here rather than up beside CORE_TOOLS, because this is
# the first line at which both lists exist. Each core package must be in the
# apps list for the FOLDER it rides in, which is the stronger statement: a
# GAMES/ package that turned up in APPS_TOOLS would put MINES.O88 in two

# Data that ships beside the programs that read it (SPEC.md 24): os88disk.py
# treats anything not ending .o88 as a plain file. Tracker with no module to
# open is a player with nothing to play, and this is the one it was written
# against - so it travels with it rather than being something you have to
# find. 116KB, which the 360KB disk can still hold alongside every package.
#
# It lives in MEDIA/ rather than beside the players in APPS/, because MEDIA
# is where a File Open starts (SPEC.md 38.10): the module Tracker and ModPlug
# were written against is in the folder their Open dialog already opens on,
# which is the whole point of having a default location at all.
#
# TeXPad's two documents are here for that same reason, and they are the
# reason the folder is not just the module's: PAPER.TEX is a short paper that
# exercises the dialect the typesetter implements, and GUIDE.TEX is the
# markup written up as a document TeXPad itself sets - so the manual for the
# markup is a worked example of it. Both are the kernel's default Open
# location, and both are ASSOCIATED (SPEC.md 69.6), so a double-click on
# either one opens TeXPad on it without going through APPS/ at all.
# BROWSER.HTM is here for the same reason and it is the browser's: a machine
# with a browser and no page on it opens its File dialog on an empty folder,
# which is the first thing a new user would see. It is ASSOCIATED, so a
# double-click on it opens the browser without going through APPS/ - and what
# it SAYS is the browser's manual, so the first page a new user opens is the
# one that tells them how to open the next.
#
# It replaced DEMO.HTM here (SPEC.md 71.12). That file was a TESTBED - it was
# written to stress the renderer while the renderer was being written, and it
# still does, in tests/htm/ where four browser rows expect it by name. What it
# never was is documentation: it describes the project to a reader who has
# already got the machine running, on a disk whose one .HTM is the only thing
# a new user has to click. 5,696 bytes of that against 3,063 of a manual.

# the disk for one file - and the apps disk was at 317/354 with it on board,
# which is 37KB of headroom for sixteen packages that are all still growing.
# So at 360KB alone the module moves off, and the two players find it on the

#
# MOVED and never copied, which is the opposite call from CORE_TOOLS above and

#
# SALES.SLK IS TWO APPLICATIONS' SAMPLE, which is why the office list is

#
# FONTVIEW gets none and needs none - it opens SYSTEM/FONTS/ on the SYSTEM
# volume (ty_gofonts goes to OSAPI_VOL_SYS, SPEC.md 19.8), never a document
# and never the disk it was launched from - and CALC has no file format at
# all. That same fact is why FONTVIEW.O88 is off the apps disks entirely now
# (SPEC.md 90.3) and why it can stay HERE without being stranded: this disk

#
# Every data file goes through the same wrapper, not just that one: os88lz's

# format - so one directory for both meant `make zset ZFMT=lzb` after a `lz4`
# one found BEVERLY.MOD up to date and shipped the LZ4 file on the LZB disk.
# The kernel caught it exactly as SPEC.md 20.13.3 says it must - a build that

# AUDIO.O88 is left off the 360KB disk: it fits with one cluster to spare
# (353/354) which is too tight to be a good neighbour, and the XT/floppy is
# exactly where streaming performance is least proven (docs/AUDIO-PLAN.md).
# It ships on the 1.44MB and 720KB apps disks, which have room.
#
# **AND MODPLUG.O88 SINCE SPEC.md 70.9** (§24.4's own argument, one step on).
# That disk was at 354 of 354 clusters - not tight, FULL - and the ANSI-BBS
# parser takes TELNET.O88 from 7 clusters to 10. Something had to go, and the
# one package on there with a stated reason is the MOD player: §24.4 already
# moved BEVERLY.MOD off this geometry onto a media disk of its own, so at
# 360KB alone MODPLUG ships beside no module to play. TRACKER stays, because
# Tracker is an EDITOR as well as a player and can make a module out of
# nothing; a player with nothing to play is the redundancy on a disk with no
# room. It ships on the 720KB, 1.44MB and 1.2MB apps disks, unchanged.
#
# Nineteen clusters for a need of three, deliberately: this geometry has been
# at zero free twice now, and SPEC.md 70.11's Zmodem receiver will grow TELNET
# again. A disk that is exactly full is a disk the next byte breaks.
#
# FONT VIEWER is already in APPS/ on the paired 360KB system disk, beside the
# FONTS/ files it opens; copying it to the software disk as well would exceed
# that disk by four clusters. Both packages ship on the roomier apps disks.
# **NONE OF THAT HOLDS ON THIS BRANCH, AND THE FILTER IS GONE.** Every figure
# above is of UNCOMPRESSED packages. Here every package, driver, module, face
# and the manual is lz4-packed (SPEC.md 20.13) and the kernel with them
# (2.9.13), so this disk built with AUDIO.O88, MODPLUG.O88 and FONTVIEW.O88
# all on it at 342 of 354 clusters - 12 spare. The paragraphs above are kept
# because the REASONS are still the reasons - a MOD player beside no module, a
# disk that is exactly full - and they are what the next thing that grows this
# geometry gives something up for. MODPLUG.O88 has since left EVERY geometry
# - RETIRED, SPEC.md 56.15 - so the MOD player half of that is history.
#
# **AND FONT VIEWER IS OFF THIS GEOMETRY AGAIN, AT EVERY GEOMETRY, FOR A
# REASON THAT IS NOT ARITHMETIC** (SPEC.md 90.3). The paragraph above is a
# capacity argument and this is not one: the room is there and the package
# came off anyway, because it reaches its faces through OSAPI_VOL_SYS and the
# copy in APPS/ on the SYSTEM disk was already the one a double-clicked .F88
# opened. So it is out of $(APPS_TOOLS) rather than out of a per-geometry
# filter, and $(CORE_SYSONLY) beside the guard is what makes that deliberate.
#
# It was also BROKEN as a filter, in a way `all` cannot show. $(APPSARGS360)
# below is the RECIPE and it was never filtered, so the two disagreed: the
# recipe asked os88disk.py for MODPLUG.O88 while the prerequisite list did not
# build it. In build/ that is invisible because `all` builds every package
# anyway; in a PRIVATE TREE that builds only what it needs (tools/os88build.py,
# and tests/small128.py is such a row) it is a hard failure naming a file
# nothing produced. A per-geometry package list has to be filtered in BOTH
# places or in neither.
# --- 360KB LEAVES SHEET AND CHART OFF, and only 360KB (SPEC.md 24.6.3).
#     Sheet went first: that geometry has 354 clusters and Clear Skies'
#     worlds became parts of its own file (88.10.5), which cost the disk
#     what a spreadsheet takes back. CHART follows it now that OFFICE360
#     exists, and the reason is different in kind - it is not that the disk
#     is short of 10 clusters, it is that a chart viewer whose ONLY launch
#     path is File > Open (it declares no association at all) is a program
#     with nothing to open once the spreadsheet it reads is on another
#     floppy. The two belong on the same disk, and that disk is the office
#     one.
#
#     THE ROW HERE IS "CURATED ONTO APPS360", NOT "SHIPS AT ALL", and it

# =============================================================================
# THE CATEGORY DISKS (SPEC.md 24.6) - office360, network360, games360
# =============================================================================
# 360KB ONLY, for the media disk's reason one step on. 354 clusters is the
# geometry that runs out first and this project keeps making applications, so
# the answer that scales is a disk per SUBJECT: a user who wants to write a
# document puts the office disk in and everything on it is for writing
# documents. The other three geometries have room for one apps disk and gain
# nothing from three.
#
# THREE THINGS ARE TRUE OF ALL THREE, and each is a decision:
#
#   1. THE PACKAGES ARE AT THE ROOT, with no APPS/ or GAMES/ over them. The
#      apps disk sorts a mixed bag into folders because it IS a mixed bag;
#      a category disk has already been sorted by the act of choosing it,
#      and a folder there is one double-click charged for nothing. The
#      kernel needs no change for it - assoc_dfold's build-time folder
#      already has 0 for "the root" (kernel/assoc.inc), and os88disk.py
#      writes a root package's ASSOC.DAT row with cluster 0, which is the
#      FAT convention the open path already reads.
#
#   2. MEDIA/ CARRIES THE DOCUMENTS THOSE PACKAGES OPEN (24.6.2). It is
#      where a File Open starts and where a Save defaults to (SPEC.md
#      38.10), so it has to exist whatever is in it - which is why
#      MEDIAFOLDER is passed even on the games disk, where nothing ships
#      into it.
#
#   3. SYSTEM/APPDATA/ IS PRE-MADE (SPEC.md 19.9). A program's own state -
#      a high-score table, a window position, a preference - goes there
#      rather than beside the user's documents, and a folder otherwise
#      exists only because a file named one, so an application that had to
#      create its own would have to handle "the disk is full" on a path
#      nobody tests. The games disk is the one that most needs it and the
#      one where it would otherwise never appear.
#
# AND THE ASSOC.DAT IS WARM ON EVERY ONE OF THEM, for nothing: os88disk.py
# builds the volume's icon+association cache out of the packages it is given
# (SPEC.md 54.7), so mounting any of these disks seeds the machine's icons
# and extension hints from THIS volume, and its folders list without a
# header read per package. That is not a flag - it is what the tool does
# with any package it is handed - so the only thing these disks had to do to
# get it was carry their packages through the same argument list.

# THEWIRE.O88 IS ON THIS DISK AND IS STILL A SYSAPP. The desktop zone launches

# argument that kept it off the apps disk (that geometry being full to its
# last cluster) does not reach here.
#
# OS88NET.COM GOES IN SYSTEM/DOS/, exactly as it does on the apps disks
# (SPEC.md 24.2), and NOT at the root: it is an MS-DOS .COM for the machine

# SET: its drivers are compressed too, and its kernel is the one that can read

#
# The media disk is NOT part of it, and that is the result rather than an

# THE EVERYTHING DISK (ON DEMAND: `make allapps`) - SPEC.md 19.10
# =============================================================================
# build/apps-all-N.img: EVERY application this project ships, on as many
# 1.44MB floppies as it takes - and the same set at 1.2MB as
# build/apps-all-120-N.img. It includes the nine that have their own disks
# and therefore never appear on the shipped apps disk - FROTZ (SPEC.md 61),
# WORD (SPEC.md 65), CWORD (SPEC.md 73.12), PACCMAN (SPEC.md 91), RUNCPM
# (SPEC.md 74), C64 (docs/C64-SPEC.md), APPLE2 (docs/APPLE2-SPEC.md) and the
# Weave family's two, WEAVE and LOOM (WEAVE-SPEC 1.2) - and 1942.
#
# IT WAS ONE FLOPPY UNTIL IT DID NOT FIT (2026-09-30). 1942's folder alone is
# 709 of the 1.44MB disk's 2,847 clusters, and `make allapps` stopped at
# "packages need 3123 clusters; disk holds 2847". tools/os88allapps.py packs
# the payload onto a SET instead, adding a disk whenever the payload needs
# one, so a new program never needs a disk list edited. It packs FIRST FIT IN
# PAYLOAD ORDER, and a TOP-LEVEL FOLDER IS NEVER SPLIT while it fits on one
# disk - WORD\, CWORD\, RUNCPM\ and the rest are each a whole program with
# its overlay and documents beside it (the tree note below). APPS\, GAMES\
# and MEDIA\ are sets of independent programs and are split only when one
# outgrows a whole floppy, between same-stem groups. Each disk carries DOCS\,
# SYSTEM\APPDATA\ and a CONTENTS.TXT that maps the whole set.
# $(ALLAPPSLIST) names the images, one a line: make, the release zip and the
# 86Box machines read it rather than a name.
#
# It is a CONVENIENCE, offered beside the shipped images on a release page
# for somebody who wants every program without curating a shelf of disks,
# and nothing in the tree boots it by default.
#
# It is NOT in `all`, and the reason is CWORD: a C package needs SmallerC,
# which tools/setup-cc.sh fetches and which is deliberately not in this tree
# (SPEC.md 73.1). A clone with nasm and python3 builds every SHIPPED floppy;
# this target is the exception, so it is on demand exactly like cworddisk.
#
# TWO GEOMETRIES, 1.44MB AND 1.2MB, from ONE payload list (ALLAPPSARGS) - two
# hand-maintained everything-lists is exactly how they drift. There is no
# 720KB or 360KB set: the shipped disks and the category disks already cover
# those machines.
#
# THE TREE: each Word gets a FOLDER OF ITS OWN rather than a place in APPS/,
# and that is a correctness requirement and not tidiness. Both carry an
# overlay resolved in the launching instance's current directory (SPEC.md
# 65.10, 67.14, 19.2.1), and a double-click on a document leaves that
# directory on the DOCUMENT's (SPEC.md 54.9) - so package, overlay and welcome
# document have to be three files in one folder or the document opens a
# program whose every menu then refuses. That is why the set splits between
# folders and never inside one.
#
# FROTZ ships without a story. The stories are fetched by tools/getstories.py
# and are never committed (SPEC.md 61), so what rides here is the interpreter;
# `make zdisk` is still where a story disk comes from.
#
# SYSTEM/APPDATA IS BUILT ON EVERY DISK OF THE SET (SPEC.md 19.9): WEAVE-SPEC
# 8.3's saveState() writes an app's .SAV into SYSTEM/APPDATA on the LAUNCH
# volume, and any disk of the set can be one.
#
# RUNCPM (SPEC.md 74.5) rides in RUNCPM\ WITH its CP/M drive A\0, fetched by
# tools/getruncpm.py out of the committed CP/M cache zip. On the single floppy
# A\0 absorbed whatever was left and shrank to one file (SPEC.md 19.10.1);
# in the set, RUNCPM\ is priced with the WHOLE fill an otherwise empty disk
# of the geometry holds, and os88allapps.py refuses if the disk it lands on
# gives it less.

#
# $(CORE_SYSONLY) IS NAMED HERE AND IT IS NOT REDUNDANT. It is exactly the
# core packages that came off $(APPS_TOOLS) - FONTVIEW.O88 today (SPEC.md
# 90.3) - and both consumers of this list need it back for reasons of their
# own. build/apps-all.img is "every application on one floppy" for a release
# page, and completeness IS its premise: it is the one image that is not
# curated, so a program missing from it is missing from the release rather
# than left off a disk. And $(LIVEARGS) is this list plus the system's own
# files: the live USB and CD are ONE volume, so there is no system disk in A:
# to fall back on there - a live machine would have carried the ten faces in
# SYSTEM/FONTS/ and nothing that opens them, which is §24.3's "working, and
# indistinguishable from broken" exactly. The apps floppies are the case that
# does NOT need it, because a machine reading one has the system disk in the
# other drive.
#
# THE FOUR PACKAGES THAT RIDE NO FLOPPY DO NOT RIDE THE SET EITHER - AND THE
# ARITHMETIC BELOW THAT PUT THEM THERE IS WITHDRAWN (SPEC.md 19.10.1): it is
# about ONE 1.2MB floppy whose RunCPM drive absorbed the remainder, and the
# set prices that drive whole and adds a disk instead. They stay live-only
# because the lists say so; whether they join is the owner's call. The record:
#
# THE FOUR PACKAGES THAT RIDE NO FLOPPY DO NOT RIDE THIS ONE EITHER, AND THAT
# IS ARITHMETIC RATHER THAN TASTE (SPEC.md 19.10.1). RECORDER (SPEC.md 35.1),
# HELLO (27.0), PACMAN (89) and SCRIBE (95) are built by `all` and carried by
# no shipped disk. Completeness IS this disk's premise, so they were put on it
# - and THE SECOND GEOMETRY IS THE BINDING ONE. build/apps-all-120.img is
# 2,371 clusters against 1.44MB's 2,847, and its RunCPM drive A is whatever is
# left after everything else: 43 clusters, 21 of the master disk's 77 files.
#
#   the three small ones   12,844 bytes with $(MEDIA_EXTRA) -> A/0 budget 43
#                          clusters down to 14, and the fill chooses ONE FILE:
#                          its own LEFT-OFF.TXT. Twenty-one programs to none.
#   SCRIBE                 56,048 more -> the budget goes NEGATIVE, -104.
#
# A negative budget is answered by choosing nothing, the image verifies clean,
# and what ships is a CP/M emulator with no CP/M on its drive A. So thirteen
# kilobytes of package would have cost that disk RunCPM, which is not a trade
# anybody asked for - and the two geometries share ONE payload list on purpose
# ("two hand-maintained everything-lists is exactly how they drift", above),
# so a 1.44MB-only entry here is not the answer either.
#
# THEY RIDE THE LIVE MEDIA INSTEAD ($(LIVEPKGARGS), SPEC.md 80.6), where the
# whole of it is 0.2% of a 32MB partition and the four cluster arguments that
# took them off the floppies are arguments about 354 clusters. This list and
# both everything-floppies are BYTE-IDENTICAL to what they were.
#
# THE "THEY WOULD COLLIDE" CLAIM ABOUT SCRIBE WAS STALE, and it is worth
# recording because it is what kept it off the LIVE media too:
# apps/scribe/scribe.asm:148 declares NO association block at all, and says in
# twenty lines why - assoc_ext_new ends in `mov [bx+3], dl`, which OVERWRITES
# rather than refuses, so a second claimant on .DOC would win or lose by
# directory order. Scribe designed the collision out at the source; the disk
# list went on believing in it.
# A local cartridge is optional; extracted files stay in the build directory.

# =============================================================================
# THE LIVE MEDIA (ON DEMAND: `make usb` / `make iso` / `make live`) - SPEC.md 80
# =============================================================================
# build/os8088-usb.img: SPEC.md 52.10's hard-disk boot, built into an image at
# release time instead of written by the installer at run time - boot/mbr.asm,
# boot/boothd.asm as the volume boot record, one FAT16 partition with
# KERNEL.SYS first and contiguous - carrying the system disk's contents AND
# the everything-disk's payload (SPEC.md 19.10). Written raw to a USB stick
# (dd, or any raw-image writer) it boots a legacy-BIOS machine, and the kernel
# adopts the partition as C: exactly as an installed machine's (SPEC.md
# 52.10.3) - which is the verification this inherits rather than needs.
#
# build/os8088.iso is the SAME IMAGE wrapped in an El Torito
# hard-disk-emulation CD (SPEC.md 80.2): the BIOS presents the file as drive
# 80h and nothing that runs can tell it from the stick. The image and the
# readme ride the ISO as plain files too, so a host that mounts the CD can
# copy the raw image off it. What a CD cannot do - remember settings, take a
# save - is SPEC.md 80.3, stated rather than handled.
#
# ON DEMAND for allapps' reason exactly: the payload is that disk's, so
# cword, the C64 and RUNCPM need the compiler and the pinned fetches. A clone
# with nasm and python3 still builds every shipped floppy and neither of
# these.
#
# THE PAYLOAD IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED: ALLAPPSARGS plus the system disk's own
# arguments (the drivers, the readme, the logo, the fonts), so a package
# added to either shipped list is on the live media without anyone
# remembering it here. The RunCPM drive-A selection is allapps' own - same
# --select, same reserve list, same folder count - so the two
# everything-payloads cannot drift apart, LEFT-OFF.TXT and all; the live
# volume has ~30MB free, so a selection priced for a 1.44MB floppy always
# fits it. SYSTEM/APPDATA exists here for the floppy system disk's reason
# (SPEC.md 19.9), and every option precedes the positional list because an
# option taking a value mid-list stops argparse collecting it (see
# APPDATAFOLDER's note above).

# --- WHAT THE LIVE VOLUME CARRIES THAT THE EVERYTHING-FLOPPY CANNOT ---------
# SPEC.md 80.6. The paragraph above is still the rule - the payload is
# DERIVED from the shipped lists and never re-typed here - and this is the
# part of it the rule could not express, because three of these payloads do
# not fit 1.44MB and one of them is wrong on a floppy by definition.
#
# THE WIRE (SPEC.md 92.11) is the one that was a BUG rather than a gap. It is
# a SYSAPPS package: the desktop zone launches it BY NAME out of the BOOT
# volume's SYSTEM/ (SPEC.md 26.7), so a copy on an apps floppy is never the
# one that runs and $(APPSYS) rightly leaves it off. But the live media is ONE
# VOLUME - it is the boot volume - so taking $(ALLAPPSARGS)' SYSTEM/ payload
# wholesale took the apps FLOPPY's answer to a question the floppy was the
# only reason for, and every live USB and CD this project has cut booted to a
# desktop whose Wire zone opened nothing. Derived as the difference between
# the two lists, so a second SYSAPPS package lands here the day it lands
# there and neither list is edited twice.
LIVESYSARGS := $(addprefix SYSTEM:,$(filter-out $(APPSYS),$(SYSAPPS)))
# THE FOUR PACKAGES THAT RIDE NO FLOPPY, AND THE DOCUMENTS MEDIA/ LACKED.
# RECORDER (SPEC.md 35.1), HELLO (27.0), PACMAN (89) and SCRIBE (95) are built
# by `all` and shipped nowhere, and every one of those decisions is an argument
# about 354 clusters - DOT DELIRIUM wanted PACMAN's six of them, two word
# processors are 49KB of one apps disk, HELLO is a worked example rather than a
# program. Here they are 0.2% of the partition.
#
# HERE AND NOT ON $(ALLAPPSARGS), which was the first shape and is wrong: the
# everything-FLOPPY is 2,371 clusters at its binding geometry and its RunCPM
# drive A is the fill that absorbs everything else, so thirteen kilobytes of
# package took A/0 from 21 master-disk files to its own LEFT-OFF.TXT and
# SCRIBE took the budget NEGATIVE. The note over $(ALLAPPSFILES) has the
# arithmetic. A live volume with 26MB free has no such trade in it.
#
# SCRIBE GETS A FOLDER rather than a second .O88 in APPS/: SCRIBE.OVL is
# resolved in the launching instance's directory (SPEC.md 19.2.1), the same
# requirement that gives each Word one - and its WELCOME.DOC is a second copy
# of the name WORD/ already carries, which only separate folders allow.
#
# $(MEDIA_EXTRA) is the category disks' documents (SPEC.md 24.6.2): SALES.SLK,
# WRITING.MD and SAMPLE.BMP, so that Sheet, Chart, ArtfulType and Paint do not
# open their File dialog on a folder with nothing they can read (SPEC.md
# 38.10). Chart is the sharp case - it declares no association, so File > Open
# is its ONLY launch path and a spreadsheet on the volume is the one thing it
# must have.
# PACMAN.O88 IS RETIRED and is off this list too (SPEC.md 89.12,
# apps/RETIRED.txt). The live volume's premise is COMPLETENESS (SPEC.md 80.6),
# which is why it was the last place the package still shipped after it came
# off every floppy - and why taking it off the floppies alone was not the
# removal anybody thought it was. tests/unit/t_retired.py reads
# build/livepayload.txt and fails if it comes back.

# the Makefile has a cut per geometry - and a cut on a volume with 30MB free
# is a decision nobody took. The list is read out of the MANIFEST at recipe

# `make combo` -> build/combo.img: ONE 360KB bootable disk with the system,

#
# THIS IS THE DEFAULT DISK FOR A FIELD OR BENCH REQUEST. Build and send this
# one unless the ask is a `make field` case (a 720KB geometry, a knob kernel,
# or an adapter pinned at boot to match an older set). It used to be the
# herc.img/cga.img pair, and what changed is SPEC.md 39.11: the adapter
# stopped being a property of the BUILD, so one disk now takes a set from both
# cards - see below.
#
# The field machine has ONE floppy drive (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md), so the
# three-disk shape `all` produces - system, apps, bench - is two disk swaps,
# and on that machine a swap is a walk to another room. This is the whole
# session on one disk.
#
# WHAT IT LEAVES OFF, because 360KB is 354 clusters and everything is more:
#
#   MEDIA/BEVERLY.MOD   42 cl lz4-packed (114 plain) - the module Tracker and
#                      ModPlug open, and the one item here that is DATA rather
#                      than software: the two players still launch, they just
#                      have nothing to open. The shipped apps360.img carries
#                      it in MEDIA/ (SPEC.md 20.13.5; media360.img is a second
#                      copy), so swap that disk in when the module is the
#                      point.
#   BIGFILE.DAT        104 cl - sysbench's cache-capacity sweep and the DOS
#                      read-rate cross-check. sysbench says so in the report
#                      and skips the row (SPEC.md 57.3 rule 2's shape); every
#                      other row still runs. It is on the `make field` disks,
#                      which is where that measurement belongs.
#   README.TXT          9 cl - the manual (lz4-packed on disk), on a disk
#                      that is for running.
#
# ...AND, SINCE THE APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES STOPPED FITTING, THREE OF THOSE -
# COMBO_DROP below. This disk carried "every application" for as long as that
# sentence was true and then quietly stopped building at all: the packages
# grew past 354 clusters, os88disk.py refused the image, and nothing in `all`
# builds combo.img, so the failure sat there until somebody asked for a field
# disk. The list is maintained BY SUBTRACTION for exactly that reason - see
# COMBO_DROP.
#
# ONE IMAGE AND NOT ONE PER CARD, and that is SPEC.md 39.19 rather than a
# compromise: the probe still finds the Hercules first (39.1), and the Control
# Panel's Display page then switches the primary to the CGA or extends the
# desktop across both without rebuilding anything. So the operator runs
# GFXBENCH, switches the display, and runs it again - and because gfxbench
# names its report after the adapter it FOUND, both sets land on the one disk
# without colliding. SYSBENCH is run once: none of its rows is about the
# adapter. This is also the PLAINEST kernel of the lot - the shipped one, with
# no VIDEO= forced - so a field request no longer hands anybody a
# forced-adapter kernel at all, which is what put a VGA machine down the CGA
# path and cost the Packard Bell 286 its first set.
# The disk is NOT write-protected - SYSTEM.CFG is what remembers that choice.
# WHICH APPLICATIONS THE 360KB COMBO CARRIES, and it is a list that has to be
# maintained now: the packages outgrew the disk, so this one has to choose.
#
# BY SUBTRACTION - COMBO_DROP names what comes OFF, and the two lists below
# are APPS_TOOLS/APPS_GAMES minus it. An include list was the other option and
# it fails the wrong way round: a package added to APPS_TOOLS would silently
# not be on the field disk, and "the benchmark you asked for is not on the
# disk I sent you" is a walk to another room (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md). Written
# this way a new package is on the disk by default and, when it no longer
# fits, os88disk.py refuses the image with `packages need N clusters; disk
# holds 354` - which names the problem and the number to beat. Drop another
# name in here when that happens.
#
# The three that went first, and why these three: 56 clusters between them
# against the 26 that had to be found, and each has a shipped apps-disk
# stablemate doing a related job, so the field machine is not left unable to
# do a KIND of thing - Note Pad and TeXPad both set text, Tracker and ModPlug
# both play modules, and Artful is the one program here whose documents (.MD)
# are not on the disk either.
#
# TRACKER and RECORDER went next, 21 clusters, and Tracker is the clearest cut
# on the disk: this image deliberately leaves BEVERLY.MOD off (114 clusters of
# DATA), so the player was here with nothing whatever to open. ModPlug had
# already gone for the same reason without the reason being stated. Recorder
# was 4 clusters and records from a sound card the calibration machine does not
# have (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md) - it is off the shipped apps disk altogether
# now (SPEC.md 35.1), so it is not in $(APPS_TOOLS) for this list to subtract
# and its name has come out. That is 4 clusters this disk gets for free and
# no decision reversed: the reason it was dropped here still holds.
#
# THREE THINGS ASKED FOR IN THAT ROUND ARE NOT HERE, AND THAT IS THE ANSWER
# RATHER THAN AN OMISSION - they are not on this disk to drop. COMBOARGS below
# is COMBOSYS360 + APPS: + GAMES: + COMBOBENCH and nothing else, so there is no
# MEDIA: entry of any kind (this image carries no data files but the two the
# benchmarks read), and OS88NET.COM rides the APPS disk's SYSTEM/DOS and has
# never been in this list. Written down because "drop it" and "it was never
# here" are indistinguishable from the cluster count alone.
#
# THE 720KB AND 1.44MB COMBOS ARE NOT AFFECTED and must not inherit this:
# they have 713 and 2,847 clusters, the reason for the cut does not exist
# there, and COMBO144ARGS below is therefore built from the FULL lists rather
# than from COMBOARGS as it used to be.
#
# MODPLUG was the fourth name in COMBO_DROP until it was RETIRED everywhere
# (SPEC.md 56.15): it is in no list for this one to subtract from, and a
# filter naming it would be the silent no-op SPEC.md 24.5 warns about.
#
# SHEET and CHART went with the spreadsheet: 57 clusters between them, sheet
# is the largest package on the disk, and neither is a field-calibration
# tool - Calc stays for the arithmetic a field run needs.
#
# PIXELSTEIN 3D (SPEC.md 97.9) goes with them: 16 clusters at 360 KB (the
# byte count is what `make` prints and nobody updates - the cluster count
# is the fact the drop rests on), it is a game and not a calibration
# instrument, and the 5150 this disk is
# for is the very machine SPEC.md 24.5's row argues cannot hold its
# contiguous carve. games360.img is where a 360KB machine finds it. The
# 720KB and 1.44MB combos are built from the full lists and carry it.
# THE 360KB COMBO DOES NOT BUILD AS OF main 2237d1ba, WITH OR WITHOUT IT:
# `make combo` stops at "os88disk: error: packages need 446 clusters; disk
# holds 354" (re-run 2026-09-14 with this package already dropped), so the
# drop is a statement about what the disk would carry, not the fix for the
# overflow - that is a decision for whoever owns the field disk, and
# tests/pxsdisk.py asserts the omission only when the image exists.
#
# DRMARCO (SPEC.md 100) goes on PIXELSTEIN's ground, with its three front
# screens: ~68 clusters at 360 KB, a game and not a calibration instrument,
# added 2026-09-30 when it stopped being a `local` package.

# applications got it from 385 clusters to 364 and the disk holds 354, so the
# last ten had to come from somewhere that is not an application.
#
# ETHER.DRV is 21 clusters - the largest single file on this disk after the
# kernel - and the machine this disk is FOR has no Ethernet card in it at all
# (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md: a 5150 with two video cards, one floppy, an ST-225
# and a SixPakPlus). So on the calibration machine it is 21 clusters that can
# never attach to anything, which is the cheapest ten this disk had left. It
# is also the only cut of that size that costs no BENCHMARK and no GAME: the
# alternatives priced at the time were Browser+Telnet (19) and Cyclone (13).
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, stated because it is a real loss and not a free win: a combo
# disk can no longer bring the Ethernet stack (SPEC.md 72) up on a machine
# that does have a NIC. `make ethertest` is the disk for that and always was -
# it ships a SYSTEM.CFG that asks for the driver before the first paint - and
# `make field`'s disks and the two larger combos are untouched.
#
# The FILE is what is missing, so nothing has to handle it: no SYSTEM.CFG on
# this disk asks for the driver, drv_boot therefore never looks for it, and
# ticking the row in the Drivers page reports what it reports for any driver
# that is not on the system disk.

# and a BIOS that knows about it, so it will not boot the calibration 5150 -
# an IBM 5150/XT ROM tops out at 360KB and its 8-bit controller runs the data
# rate to match (docs/FIELD-MACHINES.md). This is the image for QEMU, for the
# AT-class 86Box profiles, and for a Gotek or USB floppy on a machine with a
# 1.44MB drive; `make combo` is still the one for real XT-class iron.
#
# It carries the three things the 360KB combo leaves off, because every reason
# given for dropping them up there is CLUSTERS and this disk has 2,847 of them
# against 354: BEVERLY.MOD (so Tracker and ModPlug have something to open),
# BIGFILE.DAT (so sysbench's cache-capacity sweep and DOS read-rate row RUN
# instead of being skipped) and README.TXT, plus the logo so File > Open lands
# somewhere that is not empty. Same plainest kernel - no VIDEO= forced - so
# one image still covers both cards through the Display page.
#
# ...and it carries EVERY APPLICATION, which is why this is built from
# APPS_TOOLS/APPS_GAMES and no longer from $(COMBOARGS): COMBO_DROP above is a

# ETHDUMP=<file> writes every frame either way to a pcap. It is the instrument
# for this driver the way the QMP counter read is for the kernel: a stack that
# is silent and a stack that is talking nonsense look identical from inside the
# guest, and one `tcpdump -r` says which.
#
# ETHFWD=1 IS THE OTHER DIRECTION, and the paragraph above used to end "this
# test never needs it". SPEC.md 77's FTP server is the case that does: it
# LISTENS, so a client on the host has to be able to reach INTO the guest, and
# slirp gives a guest no inbound route without a hostfwd. It forwards the
# control port (host 2121 -> guest 21, unprivileged so the gate needs no root)
# and the whole of the server's passive range, because a PASV transfer is a
# SECOND inbound connection to a port the server picks - and it rotates them
# (fd_pasv_port), so forwarding one is a gate that passes once and then fails.
#
# The client is ftplib, which since Python 3.11 ignores the address in a 227
# reply and dials the one it is already connected to - so it comes back to
# 127.0.0.1:<port> and the forward catches it. That is a SECURITY default

# IBM PC 5150"). This is the fork owner's own 86box.cfg, adopted verbatim
# except for the three media paths, which named disks on their host - so a
# defect reproduced here is reproduced on the box that reported it, and a
# difference between this and `make xt` is a difference in the report.
#
# It is a 5150 rather than an XT, with the 10/27/82 ROM the field 5150 has,

# ...and the same XT with BOTH of them in it: SPEC.md 39.12-39.19's extended
# desktop on the machine it was written for. A CGA at B8000 and a Hercules at
# B0000, two CRTCs, two monitors, and 86Box opens a window per card ("86Box
# Monitor #2" is the Hercules). That pairing is the one thing QEMU cannot
# stage at all and the one `vid_dual_ok` accepts: [vid_avail] must be exactly
# VID_A_HERC | VID_A_CGA, so a second VGA-shaped card would not do.
#
# THE SECOND CARD IS `hercules_plus` AND NOT `hercules`, WHICH IS NOT A
# PREFERENCE - it is the difference between a machine that offers the extended
# desktop and one that silently does not. 86Box's plain `hercules` does not
# answer 32KB at B0000 while the card is still in the text mode POST left it
# in: vid_memchk writes 0x55 at B000:0000 and 0xAA at B000:1000 and reads the
# first back, and on that device the second write lands on the first. That is
# the MDA signature the probe exists to reject (SPEC.md 39.11.1 - a text-only
# 4KB card has no 720x348 mode to offer), so the kernel is right and the model
# is what differs; `hercules_plus` - a real 1986 HGC+, and period hardware for
# an ibmxt86 - keeps the two offsets apart and is found. MEASURED, both ways,
# by forcing [vid_dmode] to Extend and watching which card the desktop grows
# onto: `hercules` stays black in POST's text mode, `hercules_plus` comes up
# carrying the desktop. If the Control Panel has no Display page on some other
# 86Box video pairing, this is the first thing to suspect - the page is hidden
# when [vid_avail] has one bit (SPEC.md 31.10.1) and nothing announces why.
#
# THE CGA IS PRIMARY, which is what `gfxcard` means here - `gfxcard_2` is the
# card the BIOS does not own, and the OS duly comes up on the colour one. That
# matters because the primary is what the chrome is drawn on (SPEC.md 39.16)
# and what sits at the virtual origin. Swapping which monitor carries the menu
# bar is the Control Panel's job (Display -> a row -> Activate,
# SPEC.md 39.19.2), not this file's.
# It also matches vm/xt-multimon's opposite number under MartyPC,
# os8088_5150_both, which the tools/martypc configs put in the same order for
# a POST reason - so the two emulators disagree about nothing.
#
# THE EXTENDED DESKTOP IS OFF WHEN IT BOOTS, and that is SPEC.md 39.19.1: the
# kernel can detect a second CARD and nothing can detect a second MONITOR, so
# Single is the default and the second window stays dark until the machine is
# told. Control Panel -> Display -> Desktop: Right or Below. The setting is
# written to SYSTEM.CFG when the panel is CLOSED (SPEC.md 31.8), so close it
# with the box on the title bar and the next boot comes up extended.
#
# 640KB on an `ibmxt86` planar, where the two mono machines above are 256KB on
# an `ibmxt`: a second display costs no conventional RAM (both framebuffers
# are card memory) but the windows opened across it do, and a machine bought

# resolves os8088.com, and the Wire's default WIRE.CFG - none at all, which
# 92.4 reads as os8088.com:80/wire/ - reaches the live catalog over plain
# HTTP. Nothing on the host runs; there is no proxy in this path.
#
# A: is `make ethertest`'s disk and not the stock system disk, for the reason
# that disk exists: a SYSTEM.CFG that asks for ETHER.DRV before the first
# paint, so the Wire icon is on the desktop when it comes up instead of
# after a visit to Control Panel > Drivers. Same kernel, same drivers, same
# packages - one 18-byte SYSTEM.CFG different.
#
# B: is a SCRATCH 360KB disk and not the apps floppy, for thewiretest's
# reason: Add to Disk WRITES, 86Box writes a floppy image back to its file,
# and a shipped image the emulator has edited is a shipped image. It carries
# what Add to Disk needs and nothing else - MEDIA for the Save dialog to open
# in (SPEC.md 38.10) and SYSTEM/APPDATA because every disk that carries an
# application carries one (SPEC.md 19.9). It is built once and KEPT, the way
# xt-mfm's hard disk is, so what was added last time is still there; `rm
# build/wiredata360.img` starts over.
#
# This is the only machine here whose A: is not a stock system disk, and the
# first 86Box profile in the tree with a network card of any kind. It is
# interactive, like every 86Box target: tests/thewire.py is the scripted gate
# and runs under QEMU, which can host an NE2000 but is not an 8088.

# NOTHING IN build/ IS TRACKED, and that is a decision rather than an accident.
#
# For most of this tree's life the opposite held: build/ was gitignored but 41
# artifacts inside it - the kernel, both boot sectors, all three bootable
# floppies, all three software floppies, both drivers and every package's
# .bin/.o88 - were force-added and shipped, so a clone could boot without a
# toolchain. Nothing made them follow a source change, so they went stale in
# silence, and `check-images` lived here to catch that by building everything a
# second time and comparing byte for byte. It caught real staleness (two
# "Rebuild the shipped images" commits, and a merge that shipped a Paint two
# fixes out of date), which is the point: the cache had a correctness
# obligation, and the obligation was not free.
#
# A binary an artifact of THIS tree does not need to be committed:
#
#  - the toolchain is deterministic on purpose (tools/os88disk.py pins the
#    volume serial and every FAT timestamp), so `make` reproduces any of them
#    byte for byte - a committed copy carried no information a rebuild lacks;
#  - the images are published where a version can be attached to them: a GitHub
#    release, and os8088.com. .claude/skills/release-os8088 builds them fresh
#    from a clean checkout, so the release path never read the tracked copies;
#  - anyone running `make run` already has QEMU, and nasm is the easier of the
#    two to install.
#
# Three ongoing traps died with it, and they are the reason not to reintroduce
# any of this: STALE/ORPHAN/SCRATCH as a class (build/ was force-added
# wholesale more than once, which swept in a VIDEO= stamp twice and once took
# kernel.bin OUT of the repo); binary merge conflicts; and the sharpest one -
# QEMU mounts build/apps.img and build/os8088.img WRITABLE and the OS writes to
# them, so any test that saved a file or touched a Control Panel setting
# dirtied a shipped artifact and needed the image deleted and rebuilt before
# committing. Those images are now scratch, and a test may dirty them freely.
#
# The determinism is still load-bearing - it is what lets anyone rebuild a
# released image and get the same bytes - it just no longer has a make target
# guarding it.

# `clean` SPARES build/martypc, and that is deliberate. MartyPC is an
# INSTRUMENT, not an output of this source tree: it is pinned to an upstream
# commit (tools/martypc/UPSTREAM), nothing in this repo changes what it
# builds, and rebuilding it is a several-minute cargo build. A `clean` that
# threw it away made the DEFAULT test target expensive to get back, which is
# the wrong incentive when CLAUDE.md's rule is "build it at the START of a
# session". `clean-marty` is the escape hatch, and it is what re-pinning
# wants.
#
# It spares build/cc for the same reason and by the same test: SmallerC is an
# INSTRUMENT, not an output of this source tree. It is pinned to an upstream
# commit (tools/setup-cc.sh's PIN), nothing in this repo changes what it
# builds, and it is a fetch over the network - so a `clean` that threw it away
# would make the C targets need the network to come back, which is the wrong
# incentive for a check that is meant to be cheap to re-run. `clean-cc` is the
# escape hatch, and re-pinning does not need it: setup-cc.sh compares HEAD
# against PIN on every run and re-fetches when they differ.
#
# ...and it spares build/apple2-rom/.artifacts by the same test one more time
# (docs/APPLE2-SPEC.md section 1.4). The three Apple II+ ROM images are
# Apple Computer's copyright, are NEVER committed, and are a FETCH over the
# network at a pinned commit; a `clean` that threw them away would make the
# APPLE2 target need the network to come back. The ROM this tree DERIVES from
# them - build/apple2-rom/APPLE2.ROM - is an output and goes, so a rebuild
# still re-checks every SHA-256 and re-assembles the part.

# either PNG, and test-full's `drmarcoart` row says whether the committed bytes still
