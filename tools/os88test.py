"""os88test - the regression suite, in two tiers with an ENFORCED BUDGET.

    python3 tools/os88test.py fast        # a commit you keep. Budget 30s.
    python3 tools/os88test.py full        # major work reaching the integration
                                          #   branch. Budget 3 min.
    python3 tools/os88test.py --list      # what is registered, and why
    python3 tools/os88test.py fast -k api # just the rows whose name matches

THIS IS THE HAND-DRIVEN RUNNER: ONE INVOCATION, IN THE FOREGROUND, THAT YOU
WAIT FOR.  For a whole tier - and for anything that is going to take more than
a few minutes - the command is `tools/os88soak.py` (`check`, then `start`),
which preflights the box, builds the on-demand artefacts, runs ONE LANE PER
CORE, detaches so it survives your shell, and journals every row so
`start --resume` picks up where a reclaimed container left off.

**AND THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COSTS REAL TIME IS INVOKING THIS ONCE PER ROW.**
An invocation has ~22 s of fixed cost before any row runs - python, the
registry, the capability probe and the kernel-map identity check, which
re-assembles the whole kernel to prove the map describes the binary under
test.  That is paid once per CALL, not once per row, and it is invisible in
the summary line because the runner reports row time.  Measured on the 24
Clear Skies rows, 1,021 s of declared row time:

    one call, `soak -k 'skies*'`          353.6 s   (lane of 3)
    one call per row, `-k <one row>`     ~1,549 s   = 1,021 + 24 x 22

A single row measured **45.0 s wall for a 23.0 s row**.  So pass a GLOB and
let one call cover the family: `soak -k 'skies*'` (or several `-k`), never a
loop over row names.  A development cycle that feels inexplicably slow is
usually this, and it took a whole session to find the first time.

THE LANE IS NOT 1, and two places in this tree said it was until somebody
measured them.  `_default_mj()` below is CORES-1, and `make test-soak` passes
no width at all - so both it and a bare `soak -k ...` already fan the emulator
rows out.  `--marty-jobs` overrides per call and `$OS88_MARTY_JOBS` for a
whole container, which is the one to set when SEVERAL AGENTS share a box:
three agents each defaulting to three lanes oversubscribe a four-core machine
without any of them knowing.

WHEN EACH TIER IS RUN is docs/TESTING.md's `When to run which tier`, and it
is the authority: none of the three is a per-commit gate.  `full` is four
minutes and the whole soak is nearly two hours, so a change is covered by the
ROWS about the thing it touched - `soak -k '<subject>*'`, one call, minutes -
far more often than by any tier.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  This tree had ninety test scripts and no way to run them.
Each one is a real gate - `tests/dockmark.py` and `tests/heapsame.py` are
better written than most of the code they check - and each one had to be
remembered, by name, by somebody who already suspected the bug it catches.
That is exactly the failure mode `tools/checkdocs.py`'s header describes one
level up: *a check nobody types has accumulated 34 findings*.  A merge does
not know which of the ninety it should have run, so it ran none.

THE BUDGET IS THE FEATURE, and it is why this is a runner rather than a
shell script that calls everything.  A suite with no ceiling grows until it
is too slow to run, and a suite too slow to run is not run - which is the
state this repo was already in with zero seconds on the clock.  So each tier
declares a budget in seconds and THE RUNNER FAILS WHEN THE TIER OVERRUNS IT,
green tests or not. The seconds are CHARGED IN CPU (see `charge`): each row's
own user+sys laid out over the runner's lanes, which is the wall clock of an
idle box, so a loaded one cannot fail the tier for being loaded.  Adding a test that does not fit is therefore a visible,
failing decision about what to take out or move down a tier, made by the
author who added it, rather than a slow drift discovered by whoever finally
gives up on the suite.

Each row also declares its OWN expected seconds, and the runner reports any
row that overran its declaration by more than `SLIP`.  Without that the tier
budget is spent by whichever test happens to run last, and the row that
actually got slower is invisible.

THE TWO TIERS ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.

  fast   Host-side only: no emulator, no floppy, no video.  It reads what
         `make` just built - the kernel binary, the packages, the images -
         and checks the invariants that break SILENTLY.  It is cheap enough
         to hang off the default build, which is the only placement that
         makes a gate unskippable (`checkdocs` and `os88ovlchk.py` are the
         precedent).

  full   fast, plus the build matrix `all` never builds (kern_small and
         every knob), plus the emulator tests that put pixels on a screen.

WHAT A TIER MAY NOT DO.  `fast` may not build anything: it runs after `make`
and inspects its output, so a `fast` row that shells out to `make` is
measuring the build, not the tree.  `full` may build, and does.

SERIAL ROWS.  Emulator tests carry `serial=True` and share a lane behind the
host-side rows, which fan out across the others.  That used to be forced:
every emulator test drove one debug server on one fixed port, and two rows in
parallel would not fail - the second would silently drive the FIRST one's
machine.  It is not forced any more.  `os88marty.launch` gives every instance
its own port, its own run directory and its own disks (docs/MARTYPC-DEBUG.md),
so `--marty-jobs N` widens that lane to N.

WHAT STILL RUNS ALONE, and it is no longer about the emulator.  TWO flags,
and they are different claims:

  * `builds=True` - the row shells out to `make` IN THE SHARED TREE, so it
    rewrites `build/` under any row reading it.  It cannot share the TREE, and
    `tests/unit/t_registry.py` checks this one against the script rather than
    trusting it.  A row that builds into a tree of its own
    (`tools/os88build.py`) is NOT one of these, and that gate refuses the flag
    on one: the whole point is that a knob kernel no longer needs the tree.
  * `alone=True` - the row's ANSWER needs the machine to itself.  A row whose
    assertion is a RATE cannot share four cores with two other guests; nor can
    one whose clicks are paced by a host-timed settle.  It can share the tree
    and only needs the CORES.

Both keep the row out of the shared lane whatever `--marty-jobs` says, and
both land it in the one-at-a-time lane of the SAME run - so "the whole soak
except the rate rows, then the rate rows" is one command now and not two.

WHY THE DEFAULT IS CORES-1, and it USED TO BE 1.  The old reasoning was
arithmetic rather than caution about isolation (`tests/martyconc.py` is the
gate on that): guest cycle counts are unaffected by width, being counted
rather than timed, but a row's declared `secs`, its timeout and `settle`'s
patience were all HOST seconds - so widening the lane spent slack some rows
had not got.

That is the half that changed.  Those waits are denominated in GUEST time now
(`os88marty.GUEST_HZ`), so what a row is allowed is the same on a busy box as
an idle one, and contention can no longer explain a failure.  The measurement
is `docs/plans/SOAK-PARALLEL.md` 1: twelve rows at width 3 with two extra CPU hogs
passed 12/12 and ran 1.06x slower than the same rows alone.  On the pre-merge
gate - nearly all emulator rows - the default took 402s to 227.5s.

CORES-1 rather than CORES: the missing core is what a check-in, an editor or a
small side task runs on, and a run sized to fill the box exactly is one that
anything else on the box perturbs.  `$OS88_MARTY_JOBS` and `--marty-jobs`
override.

CAPABILITIES.  A row names what it needs (`marty`, `qemu`, `cc`, `net`) and
is SKIPPED, loudly, when the machine has not got it - a container with no
MartyPC build still gets the whole host-side tier rather than a wall of red.
`--strict` turns a skip into a failure, which is what CI wants once the
capability is known to be there.

    THE BUDGET IS CHARGED IN CPU AND NOT IN WALL, because wall is a property

    also running a soak failed with every row green - 46 passed, OVER BUDGET
    by 2.6s, on a tier that takes 18s on the same box idle. Contention does
    not make a row do more work; it makes the work take longer to be
    scheduled, and a gate that fails for that teaches everyone to ignore it.

    Each row's cost is its own CPU - user + sys, from wait4, which includes
